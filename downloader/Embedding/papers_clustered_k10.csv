They provide stochastic samples upon which direct numerical simulations can be conducted to populate material databases. A large ensemble of simulation data on synthetic microstructures may provide supplemental data to inform and refine macroscopic material models, which might not be feasible from physical experiments alone. However, synthesizing realistic microstructures with realistic microstructural attributes is highly challenging. Thus, it is often oversimplified via rough approximations that may yield an inaccurate representation of the physical world. Here, we propose a novel deep learning method that can synthesize realistic three-dimensional microstructures with controlled structural properties using the combination of generative adversarial networks (GAN) and actor-critic (AC) reinforcement learning. The GAN-AC combination enables the generation of microstructures that not only resemble the appearances of real specimens but also yield user-defined physical quantities of interest (QoI). Our validation experiments confirm that the properties of synthetic microstructures generated by the GAN-AC framework are within a 5% error margin with respect to the target values. The scientific contribution of this paper resides in the novel design of the GAN-AC microstructure generator and the mathematical and algorithmic foundations therein. The proposed method will have a broad and substantive impact on the materials community by providing lenses for analyzing structure-property-performance linkages and for implementing the notion of ‘materials-by-design’.","Synthesizing controlled microstructures of porous media using generative adversarial networks and reinforcement learning For material modeling and discovery, synthetic microstructures play a critical role as digital twins.

To achieve this goal, we propose a polyconvex neural additive model (PNAM) that enables us to express the hyperelastic model in a learnable feature space while enforcing polyconvexity. An upshot of this feature space obtained via the PNAM is that (1) it is spanned by a set of univariate basis functions that can be re‐parametrized with a more complex mathematical form, and (2) the resultant elasticity model is guaranteed to fulfill the polyconvexity, which ensures that the acoustic tensor remains elliptic for any deformation. To further improve the interpretability, we use genetic programming to convert each univariate basis into a compact mathematical expression. The resultant multi‐variable mathematical models obtained from this proposed framework are not only more interpretable but are also proven to fulfill physical laws. By controlling the compactness of the learned symbolic form, the machine learning‐generated mathematical model also requires fewer arithmetic operations than its deep neural network counterparts during deployment. This latter attribute is crucial for scaling large‐scale simulations where the constitutive responses of every integration point must be updated within each incremental time step. We compare our proposed model discovery framework against other state‐of‐the‐art alternatives to assess the robustness and efficiency of the training algorithms and examine the trade‐off between interpretability, accuracy, and precision of the learned symbolic hyperelastic models obtained from different approaches.

In this study, we introduce a physics-informed operator learning approach by extending the Resolution Independent Neural Operator (RINO) framework to a fully data-free setup, addressing both challenges simultaneously. Here, the arbitrarily (but sufficiently finely) discretized input functions are projected onto a latent embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions), using pre-trained basis functions. The operator associated with the underlying partial differential equations (PDEs) is then approximated by a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP), which takes as input a latent code along with spatiotemporal coordinates to produce the solution in the physical space. The PDEs are enforced via a finite difference solver in the physical space. The validation and performance of the proposed method are benchmarked on several numerical examples with multi-resolution data, where input functions are sampled at varying resolutions, including both coarse and fine discretizations.","A Physics-informed Multi-resolution Neural Operator The predictive accuracy of operator learning frameworks depends on the quality and quantity of available training data (input-output function pairs), often requiring substantial amounts of high-fidelity data, which can be challenging to obtain in some real-world engineering applications.

This architecture allows for the evaluation of the solution field at any location within the domain but requires input functions to be discretized at identical locations, limiting practical applications. We introduce a general framework for operator learning from input-output data with arbitrary sensor locations and counts. This begins by introducing a resolution-independent DeepONet (RI-DeepONet), which handles input functions discretized arbitrarily but sufficiently finely. To achieve this, we propose two dictionary learning algorithms that adaptively learn continuous basis functions, parameterized as implicit neural representations (INRs), from correlated signals on arbitrary point clouds.

This interface-level interaction largely goes unmodeled within the field, yet the interpretation of an interface-level command can differ from what was intended by the user, as a result of diminished human ability or inadequate mappings from raw interface signals to robot control signals. Interface-aware systems aim to address this limitation in robot teleoperation by explicitly considering the impact of a control interface on user input quality when interpreting interface signals for robot control. This work presents an interface-aware formulation for the direct inference of intended interface-level commands given known interaction characteristics of a control interface using data-driven modeling, allowing for teleoperation assistance without knowledge of the human’s policy. In our specific implementation, we tailor the formulation to model a user’s operation of a sip/puff interface using a network of Gated Recurrent Units, chosen for their ability to model temporal patterns and suitability for data-scarce domains.

The solidification model separates the viscoelasticity of the solid constituent, the cement gel, from the chemical aging of material caused by solidification of cement and characterized by the growth of volume fraction of hydration products. This permits considering the viscoelastic constituent as non-aging. The temperature dependence of the rates of creep and of volume growth is characterized by two transformed time variables based on the activation energies of hydration and creep. The concept of microprestress achieves a grand unification of theory in which the long-term aging and all transient hygrothermal effects simply become different consequences of one and the same physical phenomenon. The microprestress, which is independent of the applied load, is initially produced by incompatible volume changes in the microstructure during hydration, and later builds up when changes of moisture content and temperature create a thermodynamic imbalance between the chemical potentials of vapor and adsorbed water in the nanopores of cement gel. As recently shown, this simultaneously captures two basic effects: First, the creep decreases with increasing age at loading after the growth of the volume fraction of hydrated cement has ceased; and, second, the drying creep, i.e., the transient creep increases due to drying (Pickett effect) which overpowers the effect of steady-state moisture content (i.e., less moisture—less creep). Now it is demonstrated that the microprestress buildup and relaxation also captures a third effect: The transitional thermal creep, i.e., the transient creep increase due to temperature change. For computations, an efficient (exponential-type) integration algorithm is developed. Finite element simulations, in which the apparent creep due to microcracking is taken into account separately, are used to identify the constitutive parameters and a satisfactory agreement with typical test data is achieved.","Temperature Effect on Concrete Creep Modeled by Microprestress-Solidification Theory The previously developed microprestress-solidification theory for concrete creep and shrinkage is generalized for the effect of temperature (not exceeding 100°C).

The development of multiscale and multiphysics models and simulation tools naturally arises as a result of the link between basic scientific research and engineering application; while this issue is still under intensive study, we present here some of the approaches to this topic. Our concentration throughout is on the exploration of mechanical properties such as Young’s modulus, bending stiffness, buckling criteria, and tensile and compressive strengths. Finally, we discuss several examples of exciting applications that take advantage of these properties, including nanoropes, filled nanotubes, nanoelectromechanical systems, nanosensors, and nanotube-reinforced polymers.

 Additive Manufacturing (AM) simulations offer an alternative to expensive AM experiments to study the effects of processing conditions on granular microstructures. Existing AM simulations lack support from reliable validation techniques. The stochastic nature and spatial heterogeneity of microstructures make it difficult to validate the simulated microstructures against experimentally obtained images through statistical measures such as average grain size. Another challenge is the lack of reliable and automated methods to calibrate the model parameters, which are unknown and difficult to measure directly from experiments. To overcome these two challenges, we first present a novel metric to quantify the difference between granular microstructures. Then, using this metric in conjunction with Bayesian optimization, we present a framework that can be used to reliably and efficiently calibrate the model parameters. We employ this framework to first calibrate the substrate microstructure simulation and then the laser scan microstructure simulation for Inconel 625. Results show that the framework allows successful calibration of the model parameters in just a small number of simulations.","CALIBRATION OF CELLULAR AUTOMATION MODEL FOR MICROSTRUCTURE PREDICTION IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING USING DISSIMILARITY SCORE Additive Manufacturing (AM) simulations offer an alternative to expensive AM experiments to study the effects of processing conditions on granular microstructures.

To advance understanding of turbulent hyporheic exchange and porewater transport, we investigate flow over and through a rough bed of spheres using large eddy simulation (LES). We apply double averaging (combined space and time averaging) to the LES results to determine the mean velocity distribution, momentum balance, and drag forces. Our simulations show large‐scale freestream structures interacting strongly with vortices generated at the surfaces of individual spheres to control turbulent momentum fluxes into the bed. The transition between turbulent flow and Darcy flow occurs over the first row of spheres, where turbulence decays rapidly and turbulent kinetic energy, Reynolds stress, and drag forces peak. Below this region, turbulence is only present in the high‐velocity flow in open pore throats. Experimental observations suggest that minimum mean porewater velocity occurs in the first open pore space below the transition region, but our results show that the minimum occurs between the first and second pore spaces. The simulation mean porewater velocities are approximately half those captured in measurements because the model resolves the entire flow continuum while measurements can access high‐velocity fluid in open pores. The high‐resolution dual time‐space averaging of the LES resolves both turbulent and mean flow features that are important to interfacial solute and particle fluxes, providing a means to include turbulent hyporheic exchange in upscaled river models, which has not been achieved to date.","Double Averaging Analysis Applied to a Large Eddy Simulation of Coupled Turbulent Overlying and Porewater Flow Freestream turbulence in rivers is a key contributor to the flux of dissolved nutrients, carbon, and other ecologically important solutes into porewater.

ECM mechanical properties are strongly affected by collagen ultrastructure, and perturbations in collagen networks can cause tissue mechanical failure. It is thus crucial to understand the ultrastructural mechanical properties of soft tissues. Herein, the ultrastructural and nanomechanical properties of arterial tissues are reported. Specifically, maps of aorta tissue stiffness in its three constitutive layers, namely tunica intima, media, and adventitia, are reported. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) with large and ultrasharp tips is used to explore tissue stiffness at two scales. Quasistatic tensile tests are further conducted to understand a potential correspondence between small‐scale mechanical properties obtained via AFM indentation and macroscopic behavior of the tissue at low and large strains. Furthermore, gradients in stiffness across the various layers as well as deformation rate effects are investigated.

 A “cobot” is a robotic device which manipulates objects in collaboration with a human operator. A cobot provides assistance to the human operator by setting up virtual surfaces which can be used to constrain and guide motion. While conventional servo-actuated haptic displays may be used in this way also, an important distinction is that, while haptic displays are active devices which can supply energy to the human operator, cobots are intrinsically passive. This is because cobots do not use servos to implement constraint, but instead employ “steerable” nonholonomic joints. As a consequence of their passivity, cobots are potentially well-suited to safety-critical tasks (e.g. surgery) or those which involve large interaction forces (e.g. automobile assembly). This paper focuses on the simplest possible cobot, which has only a single joint (a steerable wheel). Two control modes of this “unicycle cobot”, termed “virtual caster” and “virtual wall” control, are developed in detail.

We show that a reduction of friction will also occur between a human finger and a vibrating plate. Thus, a vibrating plate can serve as a haptic interface. The amplitude of vibration can also be correlated to the amount of friction reduction between the plate and the finger.

We introduce a novel deformable body fracture mechanics approach and high-resolution strain field imaging to reveal that nonuniform stress distributions cause EA clutches to fail through delamination and crack propagation. Using this insight, we developed EA clutches sustaining 22 newtons over 1 square centimeter at 100 volts, achieving the highest stress per voltage among similar clutches.

The objective of this study was to identify quality improvement initiatives that aimed to reduce the environmental impact of the operating room while decreasing costs. STUDY DESIGN: A literature search was performed using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and Google Scholar and included broad terms for “operating room,” “costs,” and “environment” or “sustainability.” The “triple bottom line” framework, which considers the environmental, financial, and social impacts of interventions to guide decision making, was used to inform data extraction. The studies were then categorized using the 5 “Rs” of sustainability—refuse, reduce, reuse, repurpose, and recycle—and the impacts were discussed using the triple bottom line framework. RESULTS: A total of 23 unique quality improvement initiatives describing 28 interventions were included. Interventions were categorized as “refuse” (n = 11; 39.3%), “reduce” (n = 8; 28.6%), “reuse” (n = 3; 10.7%), and “recycle” (n = 6; 21.4%). While methods of measuring environmental impact and cost savings varied greatly among studies, potential annual cost savings ranged from $873 (intervention: education on diverting recyclable materials from sharps containers; environmental impact: 11.4 kg sharps waste diverted per month) to $694,141 (intervention: education to reduce regulated medical waste; environmental impact: 30% reduction in regulated medical waste). CONCLUSIONS: Quality improvement initiatives that reduce both cost and environmental impact have been successfully implemented across a variety of centers both nationally and globally. Surgeons, healthcare practitioners, and administrators interested in environmental stewardship and working toward a culture of sustainability may consider similar interventions in their institutions.","Environmental Impact and Cost Savings of Operating Room Quality Improvement Initiatives: A Scoping Review. BACKGROUND: Operating rooms are major contributors to a hospital’s carbon footprint due to the large volumes of resources consumed and waste produced. The objective of this study was to identify quality improvement initiatives that aimed to reduce the environmental impact of the operating room while decreasing costs. STUDY DESIGN: A literature search was performed using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and Google Scholar and included broad terms for “operating room,” “costs,” and “environment” or “sustainability.” The “triple bottom line” framework, which considers the environmental, financial, and social impacts of interventions to guide decision making, was used to inform data extraction.

In this study, we identified an lncRNA, FEZF1 antisense RNA 1 (FEZF1-AS1), and further explored its function and mechanism in CRC. We verified that FEZF1-AS1 is highly expressed in CRC tissues and cell lines. Through functional experiments, we found that reduced levels of FEZF1-AS1 significantly suppressed CRC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, we discovered that reduced levels of the lncRNA FEZF1-AS1 inhibited the activation of epithelial‐mesenchymal transition (EMT); the overexpression of orthodenticle homeobox 1 (OTX1) partially rescued the FEZF1-AS1-induced inhibition of protein expression. It indicated that FEZF1-AS1 may play a role in the occurrence and development of CRC by regulating the FEZF1-AS1/OTX1/EMT pathway. Furthermore, it was reported that FEZF1-AS1 is located in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of HCT116 cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assays verified that FEZF1-AS1 directly binds miR-30a-5p and negatively regulated each other. Further, we showed that 5′-nucleotidase ecto (NT5E) is a direct target of miR-30a-5p, and the inhibition of miR-30a-5p expression partially rescued the inhibitory effect of FEZF1-AS1 on NT5E.

Methods ADNP expressions in BC cell lines and paired BC and adjacent normal tissues were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Colony formation, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), trypan blue exclusion assay, flow cytometry, and nude mice tumorigenesis assay were performed to explore the effects of ADNP on growth of BC in vivo and in vitro. The impacts of ADNP on AKT signaling pathways were measured by Western blot. Results The expression of ADNP mRNA and protein was significantly upregulated in BC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis of 221 BC and 51 adjacent normal tissue paraffin sections indicated that ADNP expression was significantly associated with histological classification and pathological T and N stages. Survival analysis revealed that patients with high ADNP expression have worse prognosis with respect to overall survival and progression-free disease. ADNP knockdown markedly delayed propagation of BC in vitro and the development of BC in vivo. ADNP overexpression showed the opposite effect. In addition, ADNP can markedly promote G1-S cell cycle transition in BC cells. On the molecular level, we confirmed that ADNP mediated acceleration of G1-S transition was associated with activation of the AKT pathways in BC.

The effect of lidocaine on viability, toxicity of SH-SY5Y cells were analyzed by MTT and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays, respectively. The relative expression of miR-145 was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The impact which lidocaine brought on PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and autophagy-related proteins were examined by the western blot assay. LC3B was assessed by immunofluorescence staining. The interaction between miR-145 and AKT3 was conducted by the dual-luciferase reporting assay. Lidocaine inhibited viability of SH-SY5Y cells in a time and dose dependent manner and enhanced the release of LDH in SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, the expression of miR-145 and autophagy were enhanced by lidocaine. Transfection with miR-145 inhibitor inhibited the release of LDH and autophagy. miR-145 targeted AKT3 to inhibit PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Finally, lidocaine inactivated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways via upregulation of miR-145, and it subsequently promoted autophagy of SH-SY5Y cells. However, silence of miR-145 could reverse the promotion of the autophagy of SH-SY5Y cells.

In the current study, we demonstrated that Sinularin inhibited the viability of human renal cancer cells 786-O and ACHN in a dose- and time-dependent manner, but did not show significant toxicity against non-malignant HRCEpic cells. Cell cycle analysis revealed that Sinularin induced G2/M arrest significantly. In addition, Sinularin could induce apoptosis in cells along with caspase-3/-9 activation, release of mitochondrial proteins, up-regulation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins and inhibition of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Sinularin could also repress the activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Moreover, Sinularin triggered the activation of MAPKs and p38 activation was essential for the anti-tumor effect of Sinularin. The generation of ROS (reactive oxygen species) was critical for Sinularin-induced apoptosis since ROS scavenger NAC (N-acetyl cysteine) could block the Sinularin-triggered apoptosis.

Science, this issue p. eaau0780; see also p. 924 Battery-free, skin-like sensors enable wireless, high-fidelity measurement of vital signs in fragile infants. INTRODUCTION In neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), continuous monitoring of vital signs is essential, particularly in cases of severe prematurity. Current monitoring platforms require multiple hard-wired, rigid interfaces to a neonate’s fragile, underdeveloped skin and, in some cases, invasive lines inserted into their delicate arteries. These platforms and their wired interfaces pose risks for iatrogenic skin injury, create physical barriers for skin-to-skin parental/neonate bonding, and frustrate even basic clinical tasks. Technologies that bypass these limitations and provide additional, advanced physiological monitoring capabilities would directly address an unmet clinical need for a highly vulnerable population. RATIONALE It is now possible to fabricate wireless, battery-free vital signs monitoring systems based on ultrathin, “skin-like” measurement modules. These devices can gently and noninvasively interface onto the skin of neonates with gestational ages down to the edge of viability. Four essential advances in engineering science serve as the foundations for this technology: (i) schemes for wireless power transfer, low-noise sensing, and high-speed data communications via a single radio-frequency link with negligible absorption in biological tissues; (ii) efficient algorithms for real-time data analytics, signal processing, and dynamic baseline modulation implemented on the sensor platforms themselves; (iii) strategies for time-synchronized streaming of wireless data from two separate devices; and (iv) designs that enable visual inspection of the skin interface while also allowing magnetic resonance imaging and x-ray imaging of the neonate. The resulting systems can be much smaller in size, lighter in weight, and less traumatic to the skin than any existing alternative. RESULTS We report the realization of this class of NICU monitoring technology, embodied as a pair of devices that, when used in a time-synchronized fashion, can reconstruct full vital signs information with clinical-grade precision. One device mounts on the chest to capture electrocardiograms (ECGs); the other rests on the base of the foot to simultaneously record photoplethysmograms (PPGs). This binodal system captures and continuously transmits ECG, PPG, and (from each device) skin temperature data, yielding measurements of heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration rate, blood oxygenation, and pulse arrival time as a surrogate of systolic blood pressure. Successful tests on neonates with gestational ages ranging from 28 weeks to full term demonstrate the full range of functions in two level III NICUs. The thin, lightweight, low-modulus characteristics of these wireless devices allow for interfaces to the skin mediated by forces that are nearly an order of magnitude smaller than those associated with adhesives used for conventional hardware in the NICU. This reduction greatly lowers the potential for iatrogenic injuries. CONCLUSION The advances outlined here serve as the basis for a skin-like technology that not only reproduces capabilities currently provided by invasive, wired systems as the standard of care, but also offers multipoint sensing of temperature and continuous tracking of blood pressure, all with substantially safer device-skin interfaces and compatibility with medical imaging.

Both sets of experiments used the same loading protocol and injected pore fluid under creep conditions. When velocity strengthening rate and state friction is used to simulate the experiments on the carbonate fault gouge the results agree well with the observed onset of tertiary creep in the experiment. Thus, the simulation reinforces the observation that pore fluid injection can induce rapid slip even when the friction relation is velocity strengthening. The rate and state framework provides an interpretation alternative to the standard one of the Mohr's circle moving to the left as pressure increases. In the rate and state framework, the friction coefficient must increase with pore pressure increase. The shale has a low nominal friction coefficient (0.28) and is much more velocity strengthening than the carbonate. The simulation agrees with the observations that increases in pore pressure induce an increase in slip velocity but the magnitudes reach only about 100 microns/s by the end of the experiment. The simulation for the shale also agrees well with the magnitude of the observed displacement at the end of the experiment but observed displacement is increasing much more rapidly the calculated. Although the calculations agree well with features of the observations near failure, the overall curves of displacement and velocity are significantly different.","Rate and State Simulation of Two Experiments With Pore Fluid Injection Under Creep Conditions Abstract This study uses a spring‐block model and rate and state friction to simulate experiments conducted in a double direct‐shear apparatus on carbonate fault gouge (Scuderi et al., 2017, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2017.08.009 ) and on shale bearing rock (Scuderi &amp; Collettini, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018jb016084 ).

Thus, the simulation reinforces the observation that pore fluid injection can induce rapid slip even when the friction relation is velocity strengthening. The rate and state framework provides an interpretation alternative to the standard one of the Mohr's circle moving to the left as pressure increases. In the rate and state framework, the friction coefficient must increase with pore pressure increase. The shale has a low nominal friction coefficient (0.28) and is much more velocity strengthening than the carbonate. The simulation agrees with the observations that increases in pore pressure induce an increase in slip velocity but the magnitudes reach only about 100 microns/s by the end of the experiment. The simulation for the shale also agrees well with the magnitude of the observed displacement at the end of the experiment but observed displacement is increasing much more rapidly the calculated. Although the calculations agree well with features of the observations near failure, the overall curves of displacement and velocity are significantly different.",8

Consequently, a safe and effective geothermal operation requires an assessment of the potential for induced seismicity. Rate and state friction (RSF) is well-established as a robust description of rock friction. It is, however, strictly empirical and extension to hydrothermal conditions relevant to geothermal stimulation is problematic. We extend a microphysical model to hydrothermal conditions by incorporating thermally activated processes in fault gouges. We use a simple spring-slider model to simulate steady-state friction at a typical range of temperatures and load-point velocities. Numerical simulations show that, consistent with experimental observations, the simulated steady-state friction of granite gouges in wet conditions rises slightly with temperature, and the friction rate parameter (a − b) transitions from velocity-strengthening at low temperatures to velocity-weakening behaviors at high temperatures of about 300°C. This transition indicates the possibility of change from stable to unstable (seismic) slip near this temperature. These results also suggest that the dominant deformation mechanisms may evolve from frictional granular flow with intergranular pressure solution at low temperatures to grain boundary sliding (GBS) with solid-state diffusion creep at high temperatures. INTRODUCTION Induced seismicity in enhanced geothermal systems is generally detected in a depth range from a few hundreds of meters to several kilometers below the Earth surface where temperature and pore fluid pressure are elevated (Tomac and Sauter, 2018; Johnson et al., 2016; Atkinson, 2015; Eberhart-Phillips and Oppenheimer, 1984). The correlation between induced seismicity and geothermal production has been proposed based on many field observations, such as the Utah FORGE geothermal system (Moore et al., 2019), the Reykjanes and Svartsengi geothermal areas (Keiding et al., 2010), the Geysers geothermal field (Eberhart-Phillips and Oppenheimer, 1984), and the Geoven deep geothermal site (Schmittbuhl et al., 2021). The injection of cold fluids and extraction of hot fluids from the subsurface may cause the pressure imbalance and trigger the seismic slip in the seismogenic zone (Xing et al., 2020). Extensive studies suggest that the aseismic-seismic transition in the seismogenic zone is thermally controlled (Currie et al., 2002; Tichelaar and Ruff, 1993; Blanpied et al., 1995; Niemeijer et al., 2016; Den Hartog and Spiers, 2013; Toy et al., 2010). In addition, the seismic slip behaviors are probably linked with temperature dependence of effective frictional properties, rock composition, porosity, and plasticity in fault gouges (Tullis and Yund, 1980; Boettcher et al., 2007; Giger et al., 2007; Barbot, 2022; Scholz, 2019). The complex frictional behaviors are often captured by a standard RSF that uses a state variable to represent the structural evolution within the fault zone (Dieterich, 1979; Ruina, 1983).","Microphysical Modelling of Frictional Slip in Hydrothermal Conditions ABSTRACT Injection of fluids for geothermal stimulation has often caused seismic events that have raised concern and resulted in discontinuing the operations.

The N-alkylaminopyrazole functionalized Au NRs have been characterized by electron microscopy and spectroscopic investigation and tested in optical detection experiments of different ions, namely, Zn(2+), Cd(2+), Hg(2+), Cu(2+), Pb(2+), and As(3+). In particular, the exposure of the functionalized NRs to increasing amounts of Hg(2+) ions has resulted in a gradual red-shift and broadening of the longitudinal plasmon band, up to 900 nm.

In fact, no significant shift in the longitudinal plasmon band has been observed for any of them, while a nearly linear reduction in the plasmon band intensity versus ion concentration in solution has been detected. The very high sensitivity for Hg(2+) with respect to other investigated ions, with a limit of detection of 3 ppt, demonstrates that the functionalization of Au NRs with PyL is a very effective method to be implemented in a reliable colorimetric sensing device, able to push further down the detection limit achieved by applying similar strategies to spherical Au NPs.","Ion-directed assembly of gold nanorods: a strategy for mercury detection.

The essence of the formation of a central segregated core of the more dense particles lies in the flow, mixing, and segregation in the cascading layer. The work involves experiments and analysis.

Here the capture of passive tracer particles by a mobile collector (MC) is studied in a model two-dimensional chaotic flow with vortices. Four simple capture strategies for determining the MC direction are considered, all of which rely on periodic measurement of the local particle distribution. The ultimate success of a strategy depends on its associated motion and detection parameters as well as the underlying fluid flow. When the flow is fully chaotic or the relative velocity of the MC is large, the four strategies exhibit nearly equal effectiveness. However, when the flow is less chaotic and the relative MC velocity is small, the collector can become trapped in or outside of a vortex. Changing the particle detection parameters can prevent trapping, which improves capture. In the absence of trapping and for both high and low relative velocities of the MC, a scaling analysis explains the dependence of the capture rate on the relevant dimensionless variables based on timescales for the mobile collector and the underlying flow. For a wide range of parameters and all four capture strategies, the capture timescale depends linearly on a combination of the characteristic kinematic timescale related to the relative motion of the collector and the gradient timescale related to the underlying flow field, confirming that the capture process is properly characterized.","Mobile-collector capture of particles in a chaotic flow Removing dispersed material, such as pollutants, from dynamic fluid environments like the ocean or the atmosphere is challenging when the flow is chaotic.

In what at first appears as a puzzling result, $F_\mathrm{L}$ in granular shear flow acts in the opposite direction to the Saffman lift force on a sphere in a sheared fluid at low $u_\mathrm{s}$, reaches a maximum value, and then decreases, eventually reversing direction and becoming comparable to $F_\mathrm{L}$ for a fluid. This non-monotonic response holds over a range of flow conditions, and the $F_\mathrm{L}$ versus $u_\mathrm{s}$ data can be collapsed by scaling both quantities using the particle sizes, shear rate, and overburden pressure. Analogous fluid simulations demonstrate that the flow field around the intruder particle is similar in the granular and fluid cases. However, the shear stress acting on the intruder in a granular shear flow is much less than that in a fluid shear flow. This difference, combined with a void region behind the intruder in granular flow, which alters the pressure and shear stress on the trailing side of the intruder, significantly changes the lift-force inducing stresses acting on the intruder between the granular and fluid cases.",3

In this study, marine gas oil and biodiesel were blended at ratios of 0%, 5%, 10%, and 20% to assess their applicability to ships (Component analysis, metal corrosion, and storage stability) and potential for emission reduction (engine performance, environmental effects, and engine durability). The composition of the test fuels meet the ISO 8217:2017 standard. Metal corrosion was insignificant for carbon steel, iron, aluminum, and nickel, but not copper. Storage stability showed no sludge generation or fuel separation, although biodiesel experienced some discoloration owing to its high oxygen content. Engine performance showed no significant differences between marine gas oil and biodiesel. Emissions of NOx increased with higher biodiesel blending ratios, whereas SOx, CO, CO2, and Total hydro carbons decreased. Engine durability was good throughout the 160 hours sea trial. This study demonstrated that even at a 20% biodiesel blending ratio exceeding the 7% ratio suggested by ISO 8217:2017, can be safely used as a long-term marine fuel.","A field-study of the feasibility of the use of biodiesel in the marine industry ABSTRACTThe International Maritime Organization is making multiple efforts to reduce greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions.

However, there are still reports of gas-injection nozzles being damaged after they have been put on the market. Damage to the nozzles might result in secondary accidents in addition to worsening engine combustion conditions from improper injection. This study aims to gather fundamental information regarding the impact of different types of gas-injection nozzles on durability and to pinpoint the prerequisites for an ideal nozzle design. The results of total deformation and equivalent stress were examined for 27 nozzles that each variable was applied to in order to compare and confirm the durability by changing the nozzle shape. The cause of the nozzle temperature change according to the change in nozzle length was found to have the biggest impact on the total deformation, and it was confirmed that the effect was increased at higher temperatures. As the nozzle length increased and decreased by 2 mm, the average temperature of the nozzle increased by 47% and decreased by 53%, but the total deformation increased by 100% and decreased by 70%. It was verified that the equivalent stress was determined by the complicated interplay between the pressure inside the nozzle and turbulent kinetic energy impacted by a change in the nozzle shape. The factor that has the largest influence on the equivalent stress is the adjustment of the nozzle hole pipe angle, and the difference in equivalent stress according to this factor was found to be up to 118% and at least 44%. As a result, it has been proven that shortening the nozzle length, increasing the hole pipe angle, and enlarging the hole diameter are the most effective and expected to be used as basic data for future nozzle development.","Durability Effects of Gas Nozzle Shape on Marine Two-Stroke Dual-Fuel Engines Using Numerical Analysis To comply with rules on air pollutants released by ships, two-stroke dual-fuel engines with liquefied natural gas (LNG) as the primary fuel have been marketed and offered to the market.

Indeed, FTY720-P strongly induced polyubiquitinylation of S1P1 receptor, whereas S1P at concentrations that induced complete internalization was not as efficient, suggesting that receptor internalization is required but not sufficient for ubiquitinylation and degradation.

Administration of 16d to mice and rats drove significant decreases in circulating lymphocyte counts and plasma S1P concentrations, recapitulating the phenotype observed in mice made deficient in Spns2. Thus, 16d has the potential for development and use as a probe to investigate Spns2 biology and to determine the potential of Spns2 as a drug target.","Discovery of In Vivo Active Sphingosine-1-phosphate Transporter (Spns2) Inhibitors. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a pleiotropic signaling molecule that interacts with five G-protein-coupled receptors (S1P1-5) to regulate cellular signaling pathways. S1P export is facilitated by Mfsd2b and spinster homologue 2 (Spns2). While mouse genetic studies suggest that Spns2 functions to maintain lymph S1P, Spns2 inhibitors are necessary to understand its biology and to learn whether Spns2 is a viable drug target.

Currently, there are no vaccines or anti-viral therapies available against CHIKV. Its spread to the Americas from the eastern continents has substantially increased the count of the infected by millions. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify therapeutic targets for CHIKV treatment. A potential point of intervention is the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) pathway. Conversion of sphingosine to S1P is catalyzed by Sphingosine kinases (SKs), which we previously showed to be crucial pro-viral host factor during CHIKV infection. In this study, we screened inhibitors of SKs and identified a novel potent inhibitor of CHIKV infection—SLL3071511. We showed that the pre-treatment of cells with SLL3071511 in vitro effectively inhibited CHIKV infection with an EC50 value of 2.91 µM under both prophylactic and therapeutic modes, significantly decreasing the viral gene expression and release of viral particles.

However, current treatments to slow CKD progression are limited. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a product of sphingolipid catabolism, is a pleiotropic mediator involved in many cellular functions, and drugs targeting S1P signaling have previously been studied particularly for autoimmune diseases. The primary mechanism of most of these drugs is functional antagonism of S1P receptor-1 (S1P1) expressed on lymphocytes and the resultant immunosuppressive effect. Here, we documented the role of local S1P signaling in perivascular cells in the progression of kidney fibrosis using primary kidney perivascular cells and several conditional mouse models. S1P was predominantly produced by sphingosine kinase 2 in kidney perivascular cells and exported via spinster homolog 2 (Spns2). It bound to S1P1 expressed in perivascular cells to enhance production of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines upon injury, leading to immune cell infiltration and subsequent fibrosis. A small-molecule Spns2 inhibitor blocked S1P transport, resulting in suppression of inflammatory signaling in human and mouse kidney perivascular cells in vitro and amelioration of kidney fibrosis in mice. Our study provides insight into the regulation of inflammation and fibrosis by S1P and demonstrates the potential of Spns2 inhibition as a treatment for CKD and potentially other inflammatory and fibrotic diseases that avoids the adverse events associated with systemic modulation of S1P receptors. Description The SphK2/S1P/Spns2/S1P1 signaling axis in perivascular cells enhances inflammatory response upon injury to promote kidney fibrosis. Cell type–specific sphingosine signaling Current treatment options to slow chronic kidney disease are limited, in part due to a lack of understanding of the precise mechanisms involved with disease. Here, Tanaka et al. demonstrated that a signaling axis involving sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) in kidney perivascular cells resulted in increased proinflammatory cytokine production after injury in vitro and in mouse models of kidney disease. This pathway has known anti-inflammatory effects in kidney endothelial cells, highlighting cell type–specific responses to the same signaling pathway.

Conditions under which these defects form, and their mechanisms, are starting to be analyzed to improve reliability and structural integrity of these highly customized parts. We use in situ, high-speed X-ray imaging in conjunction with a high throughput laser, powder-blown directed energy deposition setup to observe powder particle impact behavior within the melt pool. Through fundamental observations of the stochastic, violent powder delivery in powder-blown DED, we uncover a unique pore formation mechanism. We find that a pore can form due to air-cushioning, where vapor from the carrier gas or environment is entrapped between the solid powder particle surface and liquid melt pool surface. A critical time constant is established for the mechanism, and X-ray computed tomography is used to further analyze and categorize the new type of ""air-cushioning"" pores. It is shown that the air-cushioning mechanism can occur under multiple laser processing conditions, and we show that air-cushioning pores are more likely to be formed when powder particles are larger than 70 μm. By quantifying the effect of powder particle impact, we identify new avenues for development of high-quality laser, powder-blown DED products. Furthermore, we deepen knowledge on defect formation in metal additive manufacturing, which is being increasingly utilized in high performance situations such as aerospace, automotive, and biomedical industries.","Pore formation driven by particle impact in laser powder-blown directed energy deposition.

Here, we use drifting vertical gratings to evoke directed “fictive” swimming in intact but immobilized larval zebrafish while performing electrophysiological recordings from spinal neurons. We find that directed swimming involves unilateral changes in the duration of motor output and increased recruitment of motor neurons, without impacting the timing of spiking across or along the body. Voltage-clamp recordings from motor neurons reveal increases in phasic excitation and inhibition on the side of the turn. Current-clamp recordings from premotor interneurons that provide phasic excitation or inhibition reveal two types of recruitment patterns. A direction-agnostic pattern with balanced recruitment on the turning and nonturning sides is primarily observed in excitatory V2a neurons with ipsilateral descending axons, while a direction-sensitive pattern with preferential recruitment on the turning side is dominated by V2a neurons with ipsilateral bifurcating axons. Inhibitory V1 neurons are also divided into direction-sensitive and direction-agnostic subsets, although there is no detectable morphologic distinction. Our findings support the modular control of steering and propulsion by spinal premotor circuits, where recruitment of distinct subsets of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons provide adjustments in direction while on the move. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Spinal circuits play an essential role in coordinating movements during locomotion. However, it is unclear how they participate in adjustments in direction that do not interfere with coordination. Here we have developed a system using larval zebrafish that allows us to directly record electrical signals from spinal neurons during “fictive” swimming guided by visual cues. We find there are subsets of spinal interneurons for coordination and others that drive unilateral asymmetries in motor neuron recruitment for direction control. Our findings suggest a modular organization of spinal premotor circuits that enables uninterrupted adjustments in direction during ongoing locomotion.","Spinal Basis of Direction Control during Locomotion in Larval Zebrafish Navigation requires steering and propulsion, but how spinal circuits contribute to direction control during ongoing locomotion is not well understood. Here, we use drifting vertical gratings to evoke directed “fictive” swimming in intact but immobilized larval zebrafish while performing electrophysiological recordings from spinal neurons. We find that directed swimming involves unilateral changes in the duration of motor output and increased recruitment of motor neurons, without impacting the timing of spiking across or along the body. Voltage-clamp recordings from motor neurons reveal increases in phasic excitation and inhibition on the side of the turn. Current-clamp recordings from premotor interneurons that provide phasic excitation or inhibition reveal two types of recruitment patterns. A direction-agnostic pattern with balanced recruitment on the turning and nonturning sides is primarily observed in excitatory V2a neurons with ipsilateral descending axons, while a direction-sensitive pattern with preferential recruitment on the turning side is dominated by V2a neurons with ipsilateral bifurcating axons. Inhibitory V1 neurons are also divided into direction-sensitive and direction-agnostic subsets, although there is no detectable morphologic distinction. Our findings support the modular control of steering and propulsion by spinal premotor circuits, where recruitment of distinct subsets of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons provide adjustments in direction while on the move. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Spinal circuits play an essential role in coordinating movements during locomotion. However, it is unclear how they participate in adjustments in direction that do not interfere with coordination. Here we have developed a system using larval zebrafish that allows us to directly record electrical signals from spinal neurons during “fictive” swimming guided by visual cues. We find there are subsets of spinal interneurons for coordination and others that drive unilateral asymmetries in motor neuron recruitment for direction control.

Using traditional planning models, computer scientists have attempted to replicate this capacity with some level of success but ultimately face a reoccurring limitation: as the plan grows in steps, the number of different possible futures makes it intractable to determine the right sequence of actions to reach a goal state. Based on prior theoretical work on how the ecology of an animal governs the value of spatial planning, we developed a more efﬁcient biologically-inspired planning algorithm, TLPPO . This algorithm allows us to achieve mouse- level predator evasion performance with orders of magnitude less computation than a widespread algorithm for planning in the situations of partial observability that typify predator-prey interactions. We compared the performance of a real-time agent using TLPPO against the performance of live mice, all tasked with evading a robot predator. We anticipate these results will be helpful to planning algorithm users and developers, as well as to areas of neuroscience where robot-animal interaction can provide a useful approach to studying the basis of complex behaviors.","Achieving mouse-level strategic evasion performance using real-time computational planning —Planning is an extraordinary ability in which the brain imagines and then enacts evaluated possible futures.

These investigations have revealed their potentials as versatile biodynamic agents. For example, coumarins with phenolic hydroxyl groups have the ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species and thus prevent the formation of 5-HETE and HHT in the arachidonic pathway of inflammation suppression.

Limited evidence suggests that transradial prosthesis users demonstrate shoulder and trunk movements to compensate for these missing volitional degrees-of-freedom. The purpose of this study was to enhance understanding of the effects of prosthesis use on motor performance by comparing the movement quality of upper body kinematics between transradial prosthesis users and able-bodied controls when executing goal-oriented tasks that reflect activities of daily living. Upper body kinematics were collected on six able-bodied controls and seven myoelectric transradial prosthesis users during execution of goal-oriented tasks. Range-of-motion, absolute kinematic variability (standard deviation), and kinematic repeatability (adjusted coefficient-of-multiple-determination) were quantified for trunk motion in three planes, shoulder flexion/extension, shoulder ab/adduction, and elbow flexion/extension across five trials per task. Linear mixed models analysis assessed between-group differences and correlation analysis evaluated association between prosthesis experience and kinematic repeatability. Across tasks, prosthesis users demonstrated increased trunk motion in all three planes and shoulder abduction compared to controls (p ≤ 0.004). Absolute kinematic variability was greater for prosthesis users for all degrees-of-freedom irrespective of task, but was significant only for degrees-of-freedom that demonstrated increased range-of-motion (p ≤ 0.003). For degrees-of-freedom that did not display increased absolute variability for prosthesis users, able-bodied kinematics were characterized by significantly greater repeatability (p ≤ 0.015). Prosthesis experience had a strong positive relationship with average kinematic repeatability (r = 0.790, p = 0.034). The use of shoulder and trunk movements by prosthesis users as compensatory motions to execute goal-oriented tasks demonstrates the flexibility and adaptability of the motor system. Increased variability in movement suggests that prosthesis users do not converge on a defined motor strategy to the same degree as able-bodied individuals. Kinematic repeatability may increase with prosthesis experience, or encourage continued device use, and future work is warranted to explore these relationships. As compensatory dynamics may be necessary to improve functionality of transradial prostheses, users may benefit from dedicated training that encourages optimization of these dynamics to facilitate execution of daily living activity, and fosters adaptable but reliable motor strategies.","Comparison of range-of-motion and variability in upper body movements between transradial prosthesis users and able-bodied controls when executing goal-oriented tasks Current upper limb prostheses do not replace the active degrees-of-freedom distal to the elbow inherent to intact physiology.

To understand the resolution with which prostheses should be individually optimized, we sought to characterize below-knee prosthesis users’ psychophysical sensitivity to prosthesis stiffness. We used a novel variable-stiffness ankle prosthesis to measure the repeatability of user-selected preferred stiffness, and implemented a psychophysical experiment to characterize the just noticeable difference of stiffness during locomotion. All eight subjects with below-knee amputation exhibited high repeatability in selecting their Preferred Stiffness (mean coefficient of variation: 14.2 ± 1.7%) and were able to correctly identify a 7.7 ± 1.3% change in ankle stiffness (with 75% accuracy). This high sensitivity suggests prosthetic foot stiffness should be tuned with a high degree of precision on an individual basis.

This study investigated the effect of prosthetic ankle rotational stiffness on gait parameters related to walking stability of transtibial prosthesis users. Five men walked with an experimental prosthesis that allowed for independent modulation of plantar flexion and dorsiflexion stiffness. Two levels of plantar flexion and dorsiflexion stiffness were tested during level, uphill, and downhill walking. The results demonstrate that low plantar flexion stiffness reduced time to foot-flat, and this was associated with increased perceived stability, while low dorsiflexion stiffness demonstrated trends in temporal-spatial parameters that are associated with improved gait stability (reduced variability and asymmetry).

Loss of this adaptation due to transtibial amputation can lead to instability and compensatory motions as most commercially available prosthetic feet do not permit automatic slope adjustments. A selection of slope-adaptive ankle-feet (SAAF) has been developed to promote biomimetic ankle motion while ambulating over slopes. This review evaluated the current literature to assess the effects of SAAF prostheses on sloped gait performance in unilateral transtibial prosthesis users. Methods Four databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore) were searched on April 28, 2022, for relevant articles. Search keywords covered the general terms “transtibial,” “amputation,” “slope,” “adaptive,” and “gait,” and included articles comparing an SAAF prosthesis to a non-SAAF prosthesis condition. Data were extracted for analysis, and results were grouped according to outcomes to identify trends and aid interpretation of slope adaptation effects on gait. Results Of the 672 articles screened, 24 met the selection criteria and were included in this review, published between 2009 and 2022. The non-SAAF condition included dynamic response feet and SAAF prostheses with the adaptability function inactive. Outcomes included biomechanical variables (joint dynamics, gait symmetry, toe clearance), clinical outcome measures, and energy expenditure. All SAAF demonstrated some form of foot-ankle slope gradient adaptability, but effects on other joint dynamics were inconsistent. Minimum toe clearance during incline and decline walking was greater when using SAAF compared with non-SAAF in all reporting studies. Conclusions Results generally suggest improvements in gait quality, comfort, and safety with use of SAAF compared with non-SAAF during sloped walking. However, variations in tested SAAF and walking gradients across studies highlight the need for research to elucidate walking condition effects and advantages of specific designs. Clinical Relevance Slope-adaptive prosthetic ankle-feet may improve user gait quality and comfort and enhance gait safety by increasing minimum toe clearance. Patients who encounter slopes regularly should be considered as potential users of SAAF if indicated appropriately.","The Effects of Slope-Adaptive Prosthetic Ankle-Feet on Sloped Gait Performance and Quality in Unilateral Transtibial Prosthesis Users: A Scoping Review ABSTRACT Introduction In nonimpaired human locomotion, sagittal-plane slope adaptation of the ankle-foot complex is a function driven by neuromotor control to support upright posture and forward ambulation.

The non-SAAF condition included dynamic response feet and SAAF prostheses with the adaptability function inactive. Outcomes included biomechanical variables (joint dynamics, gait symmetry, toe clearance), clinical outcome measures, and energy expenditure. All SAAF demonstrated some form of foot-ankle slope gradient adaptability, but effects on other joint dynamics were inconsistent. Minimum toe clearance during incline and decline walking was greater when using SAAF compared with non-SAAF in all reporting studies. Conclusions Results generally suggest improvements in gait quality, comfort, and safety with use of SAAF compared with non-SAAF during sloped walking. However, variations in tested SAAF and walking gradients across studies highlight the need for research to elucidate walking condition effects and advantages of specific designs. Clinical Relevance Slope-adaptive prosthetic ankle-feet may improve user gait quality and comfort and enhance gait safety by increasing minimum toe clearance. Patients who encounter slopes regularly should be considered as potential users of SAAF if indicated appropriately.",8

However, many current personalization methods are specific to a particular device and often require reprogramming, making them less accessible. In this study, we present an open-source, device-independent personalization framework that allows for human-in-the-loop optimization. This modular framework includes cost functions and optimization algorithms that use a physiological response to optimize wearable robot parameters. We tested this framework in three case studies involving diverse subjects and wearable robots. The first case study focused on personalizing an ankle-foot prosthesis using indirect calorimetry feedback. This resulted in a 5.3% and 18.1% reduction in metabolic cost for walking for two individuals with transtibial amputation, compared to the weight-based assistance. The second case study personalized a robotic ankle exoskeleton for three different walking speeds using indirect calorimetry feedback for two subjects. The metabolic cost was reduced by 1%, 2%, and 5.8% for one subject and by 20.8%, 1.9%, and 19% for the other subject, compared to a generic assistance condition for increasing speeds. The third case study personalized gait parameters, specifically step frequency, using an electrocardiogram (ECG)-based cost function along with an optimization algorithm variant, resulting in a 43% reduction in optimization time for one non-disabled subject. These case studies suggest that our personalization framework can effectively personalize wearable robot parameters and potentially enhance assistance benefits.","Framework for Personalizing Wearable Devices Using Real-Time Physiological Measures Personalizing wearable robots by incorporating user physiological feedback can improve energy efficiency and comfort.

The aim of this project was to review the current psychometric evidence on outcome measures in people with LLA to determine which measures should be included in a stakeholder consensus process. Methods: An expert panel was assembled, and a 3-stage review process was used to categorize outcome measures identified in a systematic literature review into 3 distinct categories (recommended for measures with better than adequate psychometric properties; recommended with qualification; and unable to recommend). Panelists were asked to individually categorize measures based on results of a systematic review of identified measures’ psychometric properties. Each measure’s final categorization was based on ≥70% agreement by all panelists. Results: No outcome measure attained the ≥70% consensus threshold needed to achieve a rating of “recommend.” Hence, panelists suggested combining “recommend” and “recommend with qualifications” into a single category of “recommend with qualifications.” Using this approach, consensus was reached for 59 of 60 measures. Consensus could not be reached on 1 outcome measure (socket comfort score). Thirty-six outcome measures were categorized as “unable to recommend” based on available evidence; however, 23 (12 patient-reported measures and 11 performance-based measures) demonstrated adequate psychometric properties in LLA samples and were thus rated as “recommend with qualification” by the expert panel. The panel of experts were able to recommend 23 measures for inclusion in the subsequent stakeholder review. A key strength of this process was bringing together international researchers with extensive experience in developing and/or using LLA outcome measures who could assist in identifying psychometrically sound measures to include in a subsequent stakeholder consensus process. Conclusion: The above categorizations represent the current state of psychometric evidence on outcome measures for people with LLA and hence may change over time as additional research becomes available.

It is plausible that, in addition to its mechanical effect, the integrity of the socket-residuum interface influences the ability of an individual to sense tactile cues through the prosthesis. Vacuum-assisted suspension (VAS) has been shown to reduce relative movement at this interface, providing a means to test this premise. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the effects of altering socket-residuum interface integrity through the VAS pressure level on the thresholds of perception of an externally applied vibration stimulus. Methods: Seven unilateral transtibial prosthesis users participated. Socket-residual limb integrity was altered using the VAS subatmospheric (vacuum) pressure level. Vibration perception tests were conducted at low, mid, and high vacuum levels, targeting 0, 8, and 19 in Hg respectively, and performed in partially loaded and fully loaded conditions. Vibration intensity was increased using a dial until participants delivered a verbal signal indicating it was perceptible, and the nominal intensity was recorded. Results: Intensity thresholds decreased (ie, sensitivity increased) from low to high vacuum settings when fully loaded ( P = 0.008). Differences when partially loaded were nonsignificant and variable across participants. Conclusion: This study provides preliminary evidence that altering the integrity between the socket and residual limb by modifying the vacuum level affects sensation related to the external environment experienced through the prosthesis, although translation of these findings to real-world stimuli remains to be tested.","Socket-residuum coupling integrity affects perception of external stimuli: Effects of altering the transtibial interface using vacuum-assisted suspension Background: Relative movement between the socket and residual limb can impair function in prosthesis users.

Therefore, the stiffness of the prosthetic foot-ankle components may need to be appropriately tuned to provide a balance between walking mobility and standing balance. The present research investigates both concepts to improve our knowledge about how prosthetic ankle stiffness influences standing and walking performance. Methods Ten individuals with unilateral transtibial amputation and categorized as minimum K3-level ambulators participated. Standing balance and gait analyses at three self-selected speeds were performed at three different levels of ankle dorsiflexion stiffness (Soft, Medium, and Firm) using the College Park Venture foot (College Park Industries, Warren, MI, USA). Repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were performed on relevant standing balance, gait spatiotemporal, and roll-over shape (ROS) outcomes. Gait kinetic and kinematic data were analyzed using a one-dimension statistical parametric analysis. Results Ankle dorsiflexion stiffness influenced balance and gait. Overall, the Firm dorsiflexion stiffness provided a smaller body sway on standing balance, a ROS radius close to the one of able-bodied individuals, and reduced step length asymmetry while walking. Furthermore, walking speed had an influence on ROS radii, resulting in a larger radius for slow walking speeds and a smaller one for fast walking speeds. Discussion The Firm stiffness appeared to offer the most advantages for balance and gait. The radius of ROS under the Firm condition, close to the radius of able-bodied individuals, could have caused the improvement in step length symmetry by a greater progression of the center of pressure, resulting in further progression of the prosthetic side. This information, in addition to the observed walking speed effect on ROS radii, encourages us to develop studies to examine the effect of walking speed on foot performance and improve prosthetic foot design to maintain the same gait characteristics under different walking speeds. Clinical Relevance These results improve our understanding of how a specific prosthetic ankle dorsiflexion stiffness affects standing balance and gait, which supports the prosthetist's evaluation process to determine specific individual stiffness for each prosthesis user.","The Effect of Prosthetic Ankle Dorsiflexion Stiffness on Standing Balance and Gait Biomechanics in Individuals with Unilateral Transtibial Amputation ABSTRACT Introduction Modular prosthetic ankle components have been shown to improve walking in transtibial prosthesis users, but they may reduce stability during standing.

We show that a reduction of friction will also occur between a human finger and a vibrating plate. Thus, a vibrating plate can serve as a haptic interface. The amplitude of vibration can also be correlated to the amount of friction reduction between the plate and the finger. Varying the surface friction between the finger and the haptic interface is a way of indirectly controlling shear forces on the finger during active exploration. Using finger position and velocity feedback on the display allows for the creation of spatial texture sensations",2

Achieving similarly effective collective transport with robots has potential applications in many settings, from agriculture to construction to disaster relief. In this paper we investigate a simple decentralized strategy for collective transport in which each agent acts independently without explicit coordination. Using a physics-based model, we prove that this strategy is guaranteed to successfully transport a complex object to a target location, even though each agent only knows the target direction and does not know the object shape, weight, its own position, or the position and number of other agents. Using two robot hardware platforms, and a wide variety of complex objects, we validate the strategy through extensive experiments. Finally, we present a set of experiments to demonstrate the versatility of the simple strategy, including transport by 100 robots, transport of an actively moving object, adaptation to change in goal location, and dealing with partially observable goals.","Collective transport of complex objects by simple robots: theory and experiments Ants show an incredible ability to collectively transport complex irregular-shaped objects with seemingly simple coordination.

We focus on a model that uses broadcast control inputs specified in the global reference frame. In an obstacle-free workspace this system model is uncontrollable because it has only two controllable degrees of freedom - all robots receive the same inputs and move uniformly. We prove that adding a single obstacle can make the system controllable, for any number of robots. We provide a position control algorithm, and demonstrate through extensive testing with human subjects that many manipulation tasks can be reliably completed, even by novice users, under this system model, with performance benefits compared to the alternate models.

This “whisking” behavior has generally been reported to be strictly synchronous and symmetric about the snout, and it is thought to be controlled by a brainstem central pattern generator. Because the vibrissae can move independently of the head, however, maintaining a stable perception of the world would seem to require that rats adjust the bilateral symmetry of whisker movements in response to head movements. The present study used high-speed videography to reveal dramatic bilateral asymmetries and asynchronies in free-air whisking during head rotations. Kinematic analysis suggested that these asymmetric movements did not serve to maintain any fixed temporal relationship between right and left arrays, but rather to redirect the whiskers to a different region of space. More specifically, spatial asymmetry was found to be strongly correlated with rotational head velocity, ensuring a “look-ahead” distance of almost exactly one whisk. In contrast, bilateral asynchrony and velocity asymmetry were only weakly dependent on head velocity. Bilateral phase difference was found to be independent of the whisking frequency, suggesting the presence of two distinct left and right central pattern generators, connected as coupled oscillators. We suggest that the spatial asymmetries are analogous to the saccade that occurs during the initial portion of a combined head–eye gaze shift, and we begin to develop the rat vibrissal system as a new model for studying vestibular and proprioceptive contributions to the acquisition of sensory data.","Right–Left Asymmetries in the Whisking Behavior of Rats Anticipate Head Movements Rats use rhythmic movements of their vibrissae (whiskers) to tactually explore their environment.

This raises the question: how might the rat determine the radial contact position of an object along the whisker? We developed two complementary biomechanical models that show that the rat could determine radial object distance by monitoring the rate of change of moment (or equivalently, the rate of change of curvature) at the whisker base. The first model is used to explore the effects of taper and inherent whisker curvature on whisker deformation and used to predict the shapes of real rat whiskers during deflections at different radial distances. Predicted shapes closely matched experimental measurements. The second model describes the relationship between radial object distance and the rate of change of moment at the base of a tapered, inherently curved whisker. Together, these models can account for recent recordings showing that some trigeminal ganglion (Vg) neurons encode closer radial distances with increased firing rates. The models also suggest that four and only four physical variables at the whisker base—angular position, angular velocity, moment, and rate of change of moment—are needed to describe the dynamic state of a whisker.

These responses occurred regardless of whether the stimulus was externally or self-generated and during both active and passive touch. In contrast, perioral movements that did not tactually stimulate this region of the face (e.g., chewing) produced no detectable increases in GCL activity. In addition, GCL responses were not correlated with movement extremes. When rats used their lips actively for palpation and exploration, the tactile responses in the GCL were not detectably modulated by ongoing jaw movements.

Summary Animal nervous systems must coordinate the sequence and timing of numerous muscles − a challenging control problem. The challenge is particularly acute for highly mobile sensing structures with many degrees of freedom, such as eyes, pinnae, hands, forepaws, and whiskers, because these low-mass, distal sensors require complex muscle coordination. This work examines how the geometry of the rat whisker array simplifies coordination required for “whisking” behavior 1-3 . During whisking, 33 intrinsic (“sling”) muscles are the primary drivers 4-12 of the rapid, rhythmic protractions of the large mystacial vibrissae (whiskers), which vary more than sixfold in length and threefold in base diameter 13-16 . Although whisking is a rhythmic, centrally-patterned behavior 17-24 , rodents can change the position, shape, and size of the whisker array, indicating considerable voluntary control 25-34 . To begin quantifying how the array’s biomechanics contribute to whisking movements, we used three-dimensional anatomical reconstructions of follicle and sling muscle geometry to simulate the movement resulting from a “uniform motor command,” defined as equal firing rates across all sling muscle motor neurons. This simulation provides a baseline profile of protraction under anatomically realistic but uniformly driven conditions. It does not isolate neural from biomechanical contributions but helps identify deviations that suggest active control. Simulations reveal that all follicles rotate through approximately equal angles, regardless of size. The angular fanning of the whiskers at their bases increases monotonically throughout protraction, while maximum distance between whisker tips occurs at approximately 90% of resting muscle length, after which whisker tips converge and sensing resolution increases monotonically.","Biomechanical simplification of the motor control of whisking 1.

These signals in turn depend on the morphology and mechanics of the animal's sensory structures. Although the house mouse (Mus musculus) is one of the most common model species used in neuroscience, the spatial arrangement of its facial sensors has not yet been quantified. To address this gap, the present study quantifies the facial morphology of the mouse, with a particular focus on the geometry of its vibrissae (whiskers). The study develops equations that establish relationships between the three-dimensional (3D) locations of whisker basepoints, whisker geometry (arclength, curvature) and the 3D angles at which the whiskers emerge from the face. Additionally, the positions of facial sensory organs are quantified relative to bregma-lambda. Comparisons with the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus) indicate that when normalized for head size, the whiskers of these two species have similar spacing density. The rostral–caudal distances between facial landmarks of the rat are a factor of ∼2.0 greater than the mouse, while the scale of bilateral distances is larger and more variable. We interpret these data to suggest that the larger size of rats compared with mice is a derived (apomorphic) trait. As rodents are increasingly important models in behavioral neuroscience, the morphological model developed here will help researchers generate naturalistic, multimodal patterns of stimulation for neurophysiological experiments and allow the generation of synthetic datasets and simulations to close the loop between brain, body and environment.","Comparative morphology of the whiskers and faces of mice (Mus musculus) and rats (Rattus norvegicus) ABSTRACT Understanding neural function requires quantification of the sensory signals that an animal's brain evolved to interpret.

There are no sensors along the length of a whisker; all sensing occurs at the whisker base. Therefore, a large open question in many neuroscience studies is how an animal could estimate the three-dimensional (3D) location at which a whisker makes contact with an object. In the present work we simulated the shape of a real rat whisker to demonstrate the existence of several unique mappings from triplets of mechanical signals at the whisker base to the three-dimensional whisker-object contact point. We then used high speed video to record whisker deflections as an awake rat whisked against a peg, and used the mechanics resulting from those deflections to extract the contact points along the peg surface. These results demonstrate that measurement of specific mechanical triplets at the base of a biological whisker can enable 3D contact point determination during natural whisking behavior. The approach is viable even though the biological whisker has non-ideal, non-planar curvature, and even given the rat’s real-world choices of whisking parameters. Visual intuition for the quality of the approach is provided in a video that shows the contour of the peg gradually emerging during active whisking behavior.","Demonstration of three-dimensional contact point determination and contour reconstruction during active whisking behavior of an awake rat The rodent vibrissal (whisker) system has been studied for decades as a model of active touch sensing.

Due to this observation, we conjecture that the empirical convergence can be theoretically justified, only if we change the order of picking the problem and hyperparameter. In this work, we confirm this conjecture. We prove that, when $\beta_2$ is large and $\beta_1<\sqrt{\beta_2}<1$, Adam converges to the neighborhood of critical points. The size of the neighborhood is propositional to the variance of stochastic gradients. Under an extra condition (strong growth condition), Adam converges to critical points.

To our knowledge, this is the first result showing that Adam can converge without any modification on its update rules. Further, our analysis does not require assumptions of bounded gradients or bounded 2nd-order momentum.

This paper begins by providing a theoretical justification for the role of perturbations in UQ for LLMs. We then introduce a dual random walk perspective, modeling input-output pairs as two Markov chains with transition probabilities defined by semantic similarity. Building on this, we propose a fully probabilistic framework based on an inverse model, which quantifies uncertainty by evaluating the diversity of the input space conditioned on a given output through systematic perturbations. Within this framework, we define a new uncertainty measure, Inv-Entropy.

As physics simulations often involve simplifications, their outputs should be calibrated using real-world data. In this paper, we present a diffusion-based surrogate (DBS) that calibrates multi-fidelity physics simulations with diffusion generative processes. DBS categorizes multi-fidelity physics simulations into inexpensive and expensive simulations, depending on the computational costs. The inexpensive simulations, which can be obtained with low latency, directly inject contextual information into diffusion models. Furthermore, when results from expensive simulations are available, DBS refines the quality of generated samples via a guided diffusion process. This design circumvents the need for large amounts of expensive physics simulations to train denoising diffusion models, thus lending flexibility to practitioners. DBS builds on Bayesian probabilistic models and is equipped with a theoretical guarantee that provides upper bounds on the Wasserstein distance between the sample and underlying true distribution. The probabilistic nature of DBS also provides a convenient approach for uncertainty quantification in prediction. Our models excel in cases where physics simulations are imperfect and sometimes inaccessible. We use a numerical simulation in fluid dynamics and a case study in laser-based metal powder deposition additive manufacturing to demonstrate how DBS calibrates multi-fidelity physics simulations with observations to obtain surrogates with superior predictive performance.

Surface roughness is known to amplify hydrophobicity. It is observed that, in general, two drop shapes are possible on a given rough surface. These two cases correspond to the Wenzel (liquid wets the grooves of the rough surface) and Cassie (the drop sits on top of the peaks of the rough surface) formulas. Depending on the geometric parameters of the substrate, one of these two cases has lower energy.

A variety of variants of IBM and FDM approaches have been published, most of which rely on using a background mesh for the fluid equations and tracking the solid body using Lagrangian points. The key idea that is common to these methods is to assume that the entire fluid-solid domain is a fluid and then to constrain the fluid within the solid domain to move in accordance with the solid governing equations. The immersed solid body can be rigid or deforming. Thus, in all these methods the fluid domain is extended into the solid domain. In this review, we provide a mathemarical perspective of various immersed methods by recasting the governing equations in an extended domain form for the fluid. The solid equations are used to impose appropriate constraints on the fluid that is extended into the solid domain. This leads to extended domain constrained fluid-solid governing equations that provide a unified framework for various immersed body techniques. The unified constrained governing equations in the strong form are independent of the temporal or spatial discretization schemes.

The resulting neuromechanical model reveals complex patterns and behaviors that emerge from interacting components in the system.

Methods The “mechanical health” of the esophagus was analyzed in 740 subjects including a spectrum of motility disorder patients and normal subjects. The mechanical health was quantified through a set of parameters including wall stiffness, active relaxation, and contraction pattern. These parameters were used by a variational autoencoder to generate a parameter space called virtual disease landscape (VDL).

 Deep generative models have demonstrated effectiveness in learning compact and expressive design representations that significantly improve geometric design optimization. However, these models do not consider the uncertainty introduced by manufacturing or fabrication. Past work that quantifies such uncertainty often makes simplifying assumptions on geometric variations, while the “real-world”, “free-form” uncertainty and its impact on design performance are difficult to quantify due to the high dimensionality. To address this issue, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network-based Design under Uncertainty Framework (GAN-DUF), which contains a deep generative model that simultaneously learns a compact representation of nominal (ideal) designs and the conditional distribution of fabricated designs given any nominal design. This opens up new possibilities of 1) building a universal uncertainty quantification model compatible with both shape and topological designs, 2) modeling free-form geometric uncertainties without the need to make any assumptions on the distribution of geometric variability, and 3) allowing fast prediction of uncertainties for new nominal designs. We can combine the proposed deep generative model with robust design optimization or reliability-based design optimization for design under uncertainty. We demonstrated the framework on two real-world engineering design examples and showed its capability of finding the solution that possesses better performance after fabrication.","Hierarchical Deep Generative Models for Design Under Free-Form Geometric Uncertainty Deep generative models have demonstrated effectiveness in learning compact and expressive design representations that significantly improve geometric design optimization.

Polyvinyl alcohol-sodium alginate hydrogels crosslinked with boric acid and post-cured with sulfate (PVA-SA-BS) have been applied in bioproduction and water treatment processes, but the low pH required for crosslinking may negatively affect biocatalyst functionality. Here, we investigate how crosslinking pH (3, 4, and 5) and time (1, 2, and 8 h) affect the physicochemical, elastic, and process properties of PVA-SA-BS beads. Overall, bead properties were most affected by crosslinking pH. Beads produced at pH 3 and 4 were smaller and contained larger internal cavities, while optical coherence tomography suggested polymer cross-linking density was higher. Optical coherence elastography revealed PVA-SA-BS beads produced at pH 3 and 4 were stiffer than pH 5 beads. Dextran Blue release showed that pH 3-produced beads enabled higher diffusion rates and were more porous.

However, diagnostic cutoffs have been found to vary from manufactures’ recommendations in different settings. This study aimed to establish the Aspergillus IgG reference range among Nigerians and determine a diagnostic cutoff for CPA. Methods: Sera from 519 prospectively recruited healthy blood donors and 39 previously confirmed cases of CPA were analysed for Aspergillus IgG levels using the Bordier test kit (Bordier Affinity Products SA, Crissier, Switzerland). Accuracy versus cutoff profile and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve were analysed for both CPA cases and controls using the R-Studio (2020), (Window desktop, version 4.0.2 software with R packages “nnet” and “ROCR”). Results: Among healthy blood donors, 141 (27.2%) were aged 16–25 years with median (interquartile range, IQR) of 22 (20–24) years; 304 (58.6%) were aged 26–40 years with median (IQR) of 32 (29–36) years; while 74 (14.2%) were aged 41–60 years with median (IQR) of 46 (44–49.75).

The overall diagnostic cutoff for the diagnosis of CPA was 0.821 with an accuracy of 97.1% and area under the curve (AUC) = 0.986. Conclusion: The optimal diagnostic cutoff for diagnosing CPA in Nigerians using the Bordier kit was 0.821 which is lower than the manufacturer’s recommended cutoff of 1.0. The determination of this cutoff among Nigerians will significantly enhance accurate identification of CPA and assessment of its true burden in Nigeria.","Standardization of Aspergillus IgG diagnostic cutoff in Nigerians Background and objectives: Commercial Aspergillus IgG antibody assays have become pivotal in the current diagnosis of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA).

Although membrane-disrupting agents can kill persister cells, their therapeutic potential has been mostly overlooked because of low selectivity for bacterial versus mammalian membranes. We report that the clinically approved anthelmintic drug bithionol kills MRSA persisters by disrupting membrane lipid bilayers at concentrations that exhibit low levels of toxicity to mammalian cells. The selectivity of bithionol results from the presence of cholesterol in mammalian but not in bacterial membranes. We also show that the antipersister potency of membrane-active antimicrobial agents correlates with their ability to increase membrane fluidity. Our results significantly enhance our understanding of bacterial membrane disruption and membrane selectivity. Treatment of Staphylococcus aureus infections is complicated by the development of antibiotic tolerance, a consequence of the ability of S. aureus to enter into a nongrowing, dormant state in which the organisms are referred to as persisters. We report that the clinically approved anthelmintic agent bithionol kills methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) persister cells, which correlates with its ability to disrupt the integrity of Gram-positive bacterial membranes. Critically, bithionol exhibits significant selectivity for bacterial compared with mammalian cell membranes. All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrate that the selectivity of bithionol for bacterial membranes correlates with its ability to penetrate and embed in bacterial-mimic lipid bilayers, but not in cholesterol-rich mammalian-mimic lipid bilayers. In addition to causing rapid membrane permeabilization, the insertion of bithionol increases membrane fluidity. By using bithionol and nTZDpa (another membrane-active antimicrobial agent), as well as analogs of these compounds, we show that the activity of membrane-active compounds against MRSA persisters positively correlates with their ability to increase membrane fluidity, thereby establishing an accurate biophysical indicator for estimating antipersister potency. Finally, we demonstrate that, in combination with gentamicin, bithionol effectively reduces bacterial burdens in a mouse model of chronic deep-seated MRSA infection. This work highlights the potential repurposing of bithionol as an antipersister therapeutic agent.","A selective membrane-targeting repurposed antibiotic with activity against persistent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Significance There is a critical lack of therapeutic agents to treat infections caused by nongrowing persister forms of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

However, the electrohydrodynamic flow causes either repulsion for a drop with $\mathrm{R/P}<1$, where $\mathrm{R}$ and $\mathrm{P}$ are the drop-to-medium ratios of conductivity and permittivity, respectively, or attraction for $\mathrm{R/P}>1$. We experimentally measure droplet trajectories and quantify the wall-induced electrohydrodynamic lift in the case $\mathrm{R/P}<1$. Numerical simulations using the boundary integral method agree well with the experiment and also explore the $\mathrm{R/P}>1$ case. The results show that the lateral migration of a drop in a uniform electric field applied parallel to an insulating wall is dominated by the long-range flow due to the image stresslet.","Electrohydrodynamic drift of a drop away from an insulating wall An isolated charge-neutral drop suspended in an unbounded medium does not migrate in a uniform DC electric field.

The perturbed charge in the Debye layer redistributes and destabilizes the membrane via electrical surface stress interior and exterior to the membrane. The instability is suppressed as the difference in the electrolyte concentration of the solutions separated by the membrane increases, due to a weakened base state electric field near the membrane. This result contrasts with the destabilizing effect predicted using the leaky dielectric model in cases of asymmetric conductivity. We attribute this difference to the varying assumptions about the perturbation amplitude relative to the Debye length, which result in different regimes of validity for the linear stability analysis within these two frameworks.","Instability of a fluctuating biomimetic membrane driven by an applied uniform DC electric field.

Herein, a flexible strain sensor with complete self-healing function is proposed by combining self-healable PDMS film with rich hydrogen bonds and conductive ink based on recoverable liquid metal. By adjusting the contents of different components of self-healing PDMS film and the relative mass fraction of the liquid metal ink in the strain sensor, the tensile stress and resistance of flexible sensor can be changed to match different usage scenarios.

We develop a contact mechanics model for tracking Li surface and sub-surface stresses where electrodes have realistically (micron-scale) rough surfaces. Existing models examine a single, micron-scale Li metal protrusion under a fixed local current density that presses more or less conformally against a separator or stiff electrolyte. At the larger, sub-mm scales studied here, contact between the Li metal and the separator is heterogeneous and far from conformal for surfaces with realistic roughness: the load is carried at just the tallest asperities, where stresses reach tens of MPa, while most of the Li surface feels no force at all. Yet, dendrite growth is suppressed over the entire Li surface. To explain this dendrite suppression, our electrochemical/mechanics model suggests that Li avoids plating at the tips of growing Li dendrites if there is sufficient local stress; that local contact stresses there may be high enough to close separator pores so that incremental Li+ ions plate elsewhere; and that creep ensures that Li protrusions are gradually flattened.

Granular matter serves as a prototype of collective systems far from equilibrium and fundamental questions remain. At the same time, an understanding of granular matter has tremendous practical importance. Among practical problems, granular mixing and its interplay with segregation is arguably at the top of the list in terms of impact. Granular mixing in three-dimensional systems is complicated, as flow induces segregation by particle size or density. Several approaches and points of view for analysis are possible in principle, ranging from continuum to discrete. Flow and segregation in three-dimensional systems is seemingly complicated; however, to a reasonable approximation, all of the dynamics takes place in a thin flowing surface layer. This observation, coupled with key experimental results, leads to a simple, compact and extensible continuum-based dynamical systems framework applicable to time-periodic flow in quasi-two-dimensional tumblers and three-dimensional systems (such as spheres and cubes) rotated about one or more axes of rotation.

Granular matter serves as a prototype of collective systems far from equilibrium and fundamental questions remain. At the same time, an understanding of granular matter has tremendous practical importance. Among practical problems, granular mixing and its interplay with segregation is arguably at the top of the list in terms of impact. Granular mixing in three-dimensional systems is complicated, as flow induces segregation by particle size or density. Several approaches and points of view for analysis are possible in principle, ranging from continuum to discrete. Flow and segregation in three-dimensional systems is seemingly complicated; however, to a reasonable approximation, all of the dynamics takes place in a thin flowing surface layer. This observation, coupled with key experimental results, leads to a simple, compact and extensible continuum-based dynamical systems framework applicable to time-periodic flow in quasi-two-dimensional tumblers and three-dimensional systems (such as spheres and cubes) rotated about one or more axes of rotation. The case of time-periodic systems, in its simplest version, can be viewed as a mapping of a domain into itself. The placement of periodic points can be investigated using symmetry concepts; the character of the periodic points and associated manifolds provides a skeleton for the flow and a template for segregation processes occurring in the flow.

Here the capture of passive tracer particles by a mobile collector (MC) is studied in a model two-dimensional chaotic flow with vortices. Four simple capture strategies for determining the MC direction are considered, all of which rely on periodic measurement of the local particle distribution. The ultimate success of a strategy depends on its associated motion and detection parameters as well as the underlying fluid flow. When the flow is fully chaotic or the relative velocity of the MC is large, the four strategies exhibit nearly equal effectiveness. However, when the flow is less chaotic and the relative MC velocity is small, the collector can become trapped in or outside of a vortex. Changing the particle detection parameters can prevent trapping, which improves capture. In the absence of trapping and for both high and low relative velocities of the MC, a scaling analysis explains the dependence of the capture rate on the relevant dimensionless variables based on timescales for the mobile collector and the underlying flow. For a wide range of parameters and all four capture strategies, the capture timescale depends linearly on a combination of the characteristic kinematic timescale related to the relative motion of the collector and the gradient timescale related to the underlying flow field, confirming that the capture process is properly characterized.","Mobile-collector capture of particles in a chaotic flow Removing dispersed material, such as pollutants, from dynamic fluid environments like the ocean or the atmosphere is challenging when the flow is chaotic.

Such transformations require both large in-plane expansion or contraction gradients and control over extrinsic curvature, which are hard to achieve with single materials arranged in simple architectures. We solve this problem by 4-dimensional printing of multiple materials in heterogeneous lattice designs. Our material system provides a platform that achieves in-plane growth and out-of-plane curvature control for 4-material bilayer ribs. The lattice design converts this into large growth gradients, which lead to complex, predictable 3-dimensional (3D) shape changes. We demonstrate this approach with a hemispherical antenna that shifts resonant frequency as it changes shape and a flat lattice that transforms into a 3D human face. Shape-morphing structured materials have the ability to transform a range of applications. However, their design and fabrication remain challenging due to the difficulty of controlling the underlying metric tensor in space and time. Here, we exploit a combination of multiple materials, geometry, and 4-dimensional (4D) printing to create structured heterogeneous lattices that overcome this problem. Our printable inks are composed of elastomeric matrices with tunable cross-link density and anisotropic filler that enable precise control of their elastic modulus (E) and coefficient of thermal expansion (α). The inks are printed in the form of lattices with curved bilayer ribs whose geometry is individually programmed to achieve local control over the metric tensor. For independent control of extrinsic curvature, we created multiplexed bilayer ribs composed of 4 materials, which enables us to encode a wide range of 3-dimensional (3D) shape changes in response to temperature. As exemplars, we designed and printed planar lattices that morph into frequency-shifting antennae and a human face, demonstrating functionality and geometric complexity, respectively.

Thus, we here present a method that designs completely biological machines from the ground up: computers automatically design new machines in simulation, and the best designs are then built by combining together different biological tissues. This suggests others may use this approach to design a variety of living machines to safely deliver drugs inside the human body, help with environmental remediation, or further broaden our understanding of the diverse forms and functions life may adopt. Living systems are more robust, diverse, complex, and supportive of human life than any technology yet created. However, our ability to create novel lifeforms is currently limited to varying existing organisms or bioengineering organoids in vitro. Here we show a scalable pipeline for creating functional novel lifeforms: AI methods automatically design diverse candidate lifeforms in silico to perform some desired function, and transferable designs are then created using a cell-based construction toolkit to realize living systems with the predicted behaviors.

Here, we report on a previously unknown phenomenon when embodied agents are allowed to develop and evolve: Evolution discovers body plans robust to control changes, these body plans become genetically assimilated, yet controllers for these agents are not assimilated. This allows evolution to continue climbing fitness gradients by tinkering with the developmental programs for controllers within these permissive body plans. This exposes a previously unknown detail about the Baldwin effect: instead of all useful traits becoming genetically assimilated, only traits that render the agent robust to changes in other traits become assimilated.

However it is currently not known whether such robots exist, and, if they do, how to design them. Since self similar structures in nature often exhibit self similar behavior at different scales, we hypothesize that there may exist robot designs that have the same property. Here we demonstrate that this is indeed the case for some, but not all, modular soft robots: there are robot designs that exhibit a desired behavior at a small size scale, and if copies of that robot are attached together to realize the same design at higher scales, those larger robots exhibit similar behavior. We show how to find such designs in simulation using an evolutionary algorithm. Further, when fractal attachment is not assumed and attachment geometries must thus be evolved along with the design of the base robot unit, scale invariant behavior is not achieved, demonstrating that structural self similarity, when combined with appropriate designs, is a useful path to realizing scale invariant robot behavior. We validate our findings by demonstrating successful transferal of self similar structure and behavior to pneumatically-controlled soft robots. Finally, we show that biobots can spontaneously exhibit self similar attachment geometries, thereby suggesting that self similar behavior via self similar structure may be realizable across a wide range of robot platforms in future.","Scale invariant robot behavior with fractals Robots deployed at orders of magnitude different size scales, and that retain the same desired behavior at any of those scales, would greatly expand the environments in which the robots could operate.

Using the concept of characteristic modes, this work proposes a theoretical framework for the analysis of such electromagnetic interaction and its control mechanism. The root of interelement coupling lies in the mutually induced current in the neighboring elements. Henceforth, the initial part of this work concentrates on computing the coupled current by modeling the interaction of the uncoupled modes. Closed-form formulations have been derived for quantifying the coupling impacts. The proposed formulations have been further verified with numerical examples and method of moment-based commercial solver, such as Antenna Toolbox.

Using the concept of characteristic modes, this work proposes a theoretical framework for the analysis of such electromagnetic interaction and its control mechanism. The root of interelement coupling lies in the mutually induced current in the neighboring elements. Henceforth, the initial part of this work concentrates on computing the coupled current by modeling the interaction of the uncoupled modes. Closed-form formulations have been derived for quantifying the coupling impacts. The proposed formulations have been further verified with numerical examples and method of moment-based commercial solver, such as Antenna Toolbox.

How this slip occurs is unclear. We present molecular-dynamics (MD) simulation data and results from an analytical model which support two mechanisms of slip. At low levels of forcing, the potential field generated by the solid creates a ground state which the liquid atoms preferentially occupy. Liquid atoms hop through this energy landscape from one equilibrium site to another according to Arrhenius dynamics. Visual evidence of the trajectories of individual atoms on the solid surface supports the view of localized hopping, independent of the dynamics outside a local neighbourhood. We call this defect slip. At higher levels of forcing, the entire layer slips together, obviating the need for localized defects and resulting in the instantaneous motion of all atoms adjacent to the solid. The appearance of global slip leads to an increase in the number of slipping atoms and consequently an increase in the slip length. Both types of slip observed in the MD simulations are described by a dynamical model in which each liquid atom experiences a force from its neighbouring liquid atoms and the solid atoms of the boundary, is sheared by the overlying liquid, and damped by the solid. In agreement with the MD observations, this model predicts that above a critical value of forcing, localized slipping occurs in which atoms are driven from low-energy sites, but only if there is a downstream site which has been vacated.

The balance of attractive and repulsive forces is essential for acquiring a particular stable conformation. Here we show that the adsorbed molecules redistribute into different conformations--wetting film, nonwetting, partial wetting, and pseudopartial wetting drops--depending on the parameter values. We observe that the pseudopartial wetting drop is transient and its rate of spreading fluctuates, slowing to nearly zero as it passes through particular conformations before reaching an equilibrium thin film.

In particular, the ultimate tensile strength of silk is controlled by the strength of beta-sheet nanocrystals, which is directly related to their size, where small beta-sheet nanocrystals are crucial to reach outstanding levels of strength and toughness.

However, the mechanisms of solute transport and solute rejection due to solute charge interactions with the membrane remain unclear at the molecular level. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to examine the transport of single-solute feeds through charged nanofiltration membranes with different membrane charge concentrations of COO− and NH+2 resulting from the deprotonation or protonation of polymeric end groups according to the pH level that the membrane experiences. The results show that Na+ and Cl− solute ions are better rejected when the membrane has a higher concentration of negatively charged groups, corresponding to a higher pH, whereas CaCl2 is well rejected at all pH levels studied. These results are consistent with those of experiments performed at the same pH conditions as the simulation setup. Moreover, solute transport behavior depends on the membrane functional group distribution. When COO− functional groups are concentrated at membrane feed surface, ion permeation into the membrane is reduced. Counter-ions tend to associate with charged functional groups while co-ions seem to pass by the charged groups more easily. In addition, steric effects play a role when ions of opposite charge cluster in pores of the membrane.

In the physical therapists’ group, the inter-rater reliability of four gait deviations was moderate (kappa = .41–.6). In the certified prosthetists’ group, the inter-rater reliability of six gait deviations was moderate to substantial (kappa = .41–.8). Three gait deviations achieved moderate agreement in both groups of clinicians (kappa = .41–.6). Conclusions Most gait deviations included in the Functional Lower-Limb Amputee Gait Assessment appear stable over time when used by the same clinician. Six gait deviations in the certified prosthetists’ group and four in the physical therapists’ group may be used by multiple clinicians, and three gait deviations may be used across both professions to assist in communication and collaboration on the best course of treatment for a patient with a unilateral lower limb amputation.",8

Therefore, the stiffness of the prosthetic foot-ankle components may need to be appropriately tuned to provide a balance between walking mobility and standing balance. The present research investigates both concepts to improve our knowledge about how prosthetic ankle stiffness influences standing and walking performance. Methods Ten individuals with unilateral transtibial amputation and categorized as minimum K3-level ambulators participated. Standing balance and gait analyses at three self-selected speeds were performed at three different levels of ankle dorsiflexion stiffness (Soft, Medium, and Firm) using the College Park Venture foot (College Park Industries, Warren, MI, USA). Repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were performed on relevant standing balance, gait spatiotemporal, and roll-over shape (ROS) outcomes. Gait kinetic and kinematic data were analyzed using a one-dimension statistical parametric analysis. Results Ankle dorsiflexion stiffness influenced balance and gait. Overall, the Firm dorsiflexion stiffness provided a smaller body sway on standing balance, a ROS radius close to the one of able-bodied individuals, and reduced step length asymmetry while walking. Furthermore, walking speed had an influence on ROS radii, resulting in a larger radius for slow walking speeds and a smaller one for fast walking speeds. Discussion The Firm stiffness appeared to offer the most advantages for balance and gait. The radius of ROS under the Firm condition, close to the radius of able-bodied individuals, could have caused the improvement in step length symmetry by a greater progression of the center of pressure, resulting in further progression of the prosthetic side. This information, in addition to the observed walking speed effect on ROS radii, encourages us to develop studies to examine the effect of walking speed on foot performance and improve prosthetic foot design to maintain the same gait characteristics under different walking speeds. Clinical Relevance These results improve our understanding of how a specific prosthetic ankle dorsiflexion stiffness affects standing balance and gait, which supports the prosthetist's evaluation process to determine specific individual stiffness for each prosthesis user.","The Effect of Prosthetic Ankle Dorsiflexion Stiffness on Standing Balance and Gait Biomechanics in Individuals with Unilateral Transtibial Amputation ABSTRACT Introduction Modular prosthetic ankle components have been shown to improve walking in transtibial prosthesis users, but they may reduce stability during standing.

Previous studies found that walking with a SAP improved lower-limb prosthesis users’ comfort and residual limb pain. While longitudinal stiffness of a SAP has been shown to affect gait kinematics, kinetics, and work done by the entire lower limb, the energetic contributions from the prosthesis and the intact joints have not been examined. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of SAP stiffness and walking speed on the mechanical work contributions of the prosthesis (i.e., all components distal to socket), knee, and hip in individuals with a transtibial amputation. Twelve participants with unilateral transtibial amputation walked overground at their customary (1.22 ± 0.18 ms−1) and fast speeds (1.53 ± 0.29 ms−1) under four different levels of SAP stiffness. Power and mechanical work profiles of the leg joints and components distal to the socket were quantified. The effects of SAP stiffness and walking speed on positive and negative work were analyzed using two-factor (stiffness and speed) repeated-measure ANOVAs (α = 0.05). Faster walking significantly increased mechanical work from the SAP-integrated prosthesis (p < 0.001). Reducing SAP stiffness increased the magnitude of prosthesis negative work (energy absorption) during early stance (p = 0.045) by as much as 0.027 Jkg−1, without affecting the positive work (energy return) during late stance (p = 0.159), suggesting a damping effect. This energy loss was partially offset by an increase in residual hip positive work (as much as 0.012 Jkg−1) during late stance (p = 0.045). Reducing SAP stiffness also reduced the magnitude of negative work on the contralateral sound limb during early stance by 11–17% (p = 0.001). Reducing SAP stiffness and faster walking amplified the prostheses damping effect, which redistributed the mechanical work, both in magnitude and timing, within the residual joints and sound limb. With its capacity to absorb and dissipate energy, future studies are warranted to determine whether SAPs can provide additional user benefit for locomotor tasks that require greater attenuation of impact forces (e.g., load carriage) or energy dissipation (e.g., downhill walking).","Reducing stiffness of shock-absorbing pylon amplifies prosthesis energy loss and redistributes joint mechanical work during walking A shock-absorbing pylon (SAP) is a modular prosthetic component designed to attenuate impact forces, which unlike traditional pylons that are rigid, can compress to absorb, return, or dissipate energy.

The first 2 days included presentations on the current state of affairs of rehabilitation services in various countries and efforts made by several member states to integrate rehabilitation into their health care systems. Further, participants discussed strategies to make rehabilitation a political priority. Over the next 2 days, the WHO's staff, together with the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research, initiated a planning process for a health policy and research agenda related to rehabilitation. The objectives of this companion meeting were to (1) agree on a health policy and systems research framework for rehabilitation; (2) identify initial research questions; and (3) delineate enablers and barriers to building health systems and policy research capacity in rehabilitation. Alarcos Cieza, PhD, the WHO's Coordinator for Blindness and Deafness Prevention, and Disability and Rehabilitation, wrote in an article titled, ""Rehabilitation the Health Strategy of the 21st Century, Really?""2 that rehabilitation stakeholders must adopt a unified message that emphasizes the importance of functioning in order for it to become a political priority worldwide. She argues that coordinated advocacy by rehabilitation professional groups, subspecialties, and users is required to achieve this goal. Her message highlights the critical work undertaken by the WHO to enhance access to rehabilitation, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Accessible and affordable rehabilitation services are critical for people with chronic health conditions to maintain or increase their independence, participate in their communities, improve their economic productivity, and enhance their quality of life. The aging population not only represents a major challenge to high-income nations but to low- and middle-income nations as well. The comorbid increase in the prevalence of chronic conditions and the aging of the world's population contribute to an increasing number of people who experience declines in functioning. It is now recognized that optimizing functioning at all ages is a major global public health goal. Recent estimates of the global effect of rehabilitation on persons with health conditions is estimated to be much higher than the 1 billion people in the World Report on Disability published in 2011.3 Rehabilitation is unique in its contribution to this public health agenda because of its focuses on optimizing function. In fact, Jesus et al4 reported that the need for physical medicine and rehabilitation services has been increasing significantly in per capita terms as is the percentage of total years lived with disability globally and across countries of varying income levels. These authors also highlighted that this growth was greater in lower-income countries where rehabilitation is underresourced, emphasizing the pressing needs in these countries. It is now essential to include data on functioning in health information systems in addition to the typical morbidity and mortality outcomes. These data can help us make better-informed decisions for the increased demand of rehabilitation services to enhance function as well as assist in the planning of health care systems for future expansion into these types of services. It is evident to us that rehabilitation must be integrated fully into a nation's health system and be strengthened specifically at the primary care level in order to increase access and achieve its full potential. As the WHO highlighted, we agree that health systems must be strengthened to assure that everyone who needs rehabilitation receives it. Equity should be a fundamental goal regardless of one's social, economic, demographic, or geographic situation. WHO member states must also find solutions to the paucity of trained rehabilitation professionals and mechanisms to pay for the implementation of such services. As editors-in-chief of rehabilitation journals, we unanimously accepted the invitation to participate in WHO's Rehabilitation 2030 meetings and we embrace the concept of function as WHO's third health indicator5 along with mortality and morbidity. We recognize the increasing importance of health policy planning in improving access to rehabilitation services. In addition, we recognize that health policy requires a foundation of evidence on which health policy planning can build cost-effective systems and services. The emphasis of our journals varies widely and it is our diversity that supports the accumulating evidence base on which health policy planners, rehabilitation providers, users of rehabilitation services, and other stakeholders depend. We encourage authors to consider the global health policy implications of their research when they prepare their research reports for publication and to make these implications explicit.

In this article, we report that vitamin D receptor signaling attenuates TLR-mediated inflammation by enhancing the negative feedback inhibition.

In this article, we report that vitamin D receptor signaling attenuates TLR-mediated inflammation by enhancing the negative feedback inhibition.

Prior studies using murine models of MS indicate that remyelination within the adult central nervous system (CNS) requires the expression and activity of TNFR2 and CXCR4 by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), promoting their proliferation and differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes. Here, we extend these studies by examining the role of TNFR2 in the expression of the CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12, within the corpus callosum (CC) during cuprizone (CPZ) intoxication and by demonstrating that lentiviral-mediated gene delivery of CXCL12 to the demyelinated CC improves OPC proliferation and myelin expression during remyelination. Activated astrocytes and microglia express both TNFR1 and TNFR2 within the demyelinated CC. However, CPZ intoxicated TNFR2−/− mice exhibit loss of up-regulation of CXCL12 in astrocytes with concomitant decreases in numbers of CXCR4+ NG2+ OPCs within the CC. While CXCR4 antagonism does not affect OPC migration from subventricular zones into the CC, it decreases their proliferation and differentiation within the CC. Stereotactic delivery of lentivirus expressing CXCL12 protein into the CC of acutely demyelinated TNFR2−/− mice increases OPC proliferation and expression of myelin. In contrast, chronically demyelinated wild-type mice, which exhibit significant loss of astrocytes and OPCs, are unable to be rescued via CXCL12 lentivirus alone but instead required engraftment of CXCL12-expressing astrocytes for increased myelin expression. Our results show that TNFR2 activation induces CXCL12 expression in the demyelinated CC via autocrine signaling specifically within astrocytes, which promotes OPC proliferation and differentiation.

Methods Firstly, the relationship between YTHDC2 and CRC in TCGA database was analyzed to identify relevant signaling pathways and biological processes. Then, western blot was used to analyze expression of YTHDC2 in HCT116 and Caco2 cells. After knockdown or overexpression of YTHDC2 in the above cells, RT-PCR and western blot were used to analyze p38MAPK, p-p38MAPK, and downstream apoptosis-related proteins in the MAPK signaling pathway. Flow cytometry was performed to detect changes in apoptosis. Results And the results were shown that the expression of YTHDC2 was significantly lower in tumor tissues than in normal tissues.

This function makes it possible to use majorization minimization techniques and reduces bundle adjustment to independent optimization subproblems that can be solved in parallel. We further apply Nesterov's acceleration and adaptive restart to improve convergence while maintaining its theoretical guarantees. Despite limited peer-to-peer communication, our method has provable convergence to first-order critical points under mild conditions. On extensive benchmarks with public datasets, our method converges much faster than decentralized baselines with similar memory usage and communication load. Compared to centralized baselines using a single device, our method, while being decentralized, yields more accurate solutions with significant speedups of up to 953.7x over Ceres and 174.6x over DeepLM.

Limitations in soft robotic control and perception force researchers to hand-craft open loop controllers for gait sequences, which is a non-trivial process. Moreover, short soft actuator lifespans and natural variations in actuator behavior limit machine learning techniques to settings that can be learned on the same time scales as robot deployment. Lastly, simulation is not always possible, due to heterogeneity and nonlinearity in soft robotic materials and their dynamics change due to wear. We present a sample-efficient, simulation free, method for self-generating soft robot gaits, using very minimal computation. This technique is demonstrated on a motorized soft robotic quadruped that walks using four legs constructed from 16 “handed shearing auxetic” (HSA) actuators. To manage the dimension of the search space, gaits are composed of two sequential sets of leg motions selected from 7 possible primitives. Pairs of primitives are executed on one leg at a time; we then select the best-performing pair to execute while moving on to subsequent legs. This method-which uses no simulation, sophisticated computation, or user input-consistently generates good translation and rotation gaits in as low as 4 minutes of hardware experimentation, outperforming hand-crafted gaits. This is the first demonstration of completely autonomous gait generation in a soft robot.","Automated Gait Generation for Walking, Soft Robotic Quadrupeds Gait generation for soft robots is challenging due to the nonlinear dynamics and high dimensional input spaces of soft actuators.

We introduce a robot-assisted virtual dynamic task with a tunable resonant frequency.

In conclusion, elevated childhood serum uric acid levels are associated with increased blood pressure beginning in childhood and higher blood pressure levels that persist into adulthood, in males and females, whites and blacks, suggesting that early elevations in serum uric acid levels may play a key role in the development of human hypertension.",8

Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR) is a relatively constant anthropometric index of abdominal obesity across different age, sex or racial groups. However, information is scant on the utility of WHtR in assessing the status of abdominal obesity and related cardiometabolic risk profile among normal weight and overweight/obese children, categorized according to the accepted BMI threshold values.MethodsCross-sectional cardiometabolic risk factor variables on 3091 black and white children (56% white, 50% male), 4-18 years of age were used. Based on the age-, race- and sex-specific percentiles of BMI, the children were classified as normal weight (5th - 85th percentiles) and overweight/obese (≥ 85th percentile). The risk profiles of each group based on the WHtR (<0.5, no central obesity versus ≥ 0.5, central obesity) were compared.Results9.2% of the children in the normal weight group were centrally obese (WHtR ≥0.5) and 19.8% among the overweight/obese were not (WHtR < 0.5). On multivariate analysis the normal weight centrally obese children were 1.66, 2.01, 1.47 and 2.05 times more likely to have significant adverse levels of LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and insulin, respectively. In addition to having a higher prevalence of parental history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, the normal weight central obesity group showed a significantly higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (p < 0.0001). In the overweight/obese group, those without central obesity were 0.53 and 0.27 times less likely to have significant adverse levels of HDL cholesterol and HOMA-IR, respectively (p < 0.05), as compared to those with central obesity.

It remains unclear how metabolic health change from childhood to adulthood across different BMI categories and how such dynamic changes from childhood to adulthood might affect risk of cardiometabolic outcomes in adulthood. Therefore, we aimed to examine the effects of changes in body size phenotypes between childhood and adulthood on risks of diabetes and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in adulthood. Methods: We included 3,351 individuals who participated as both children and adults in the Bogalusa Heart Study. The mean follow-up period was 36 years. Body size phenotypes for both children and adults were defined by harmonized criteria. Results: Compared with participants with persistently metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW) from childhood to adulthood, MHNW children who became metabolically unhealthy in adulthood had increased diabetes burden and LVH risk in adulthood; Metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUNW) children who became MHNW or metabolically healthy obese (MHO) as adults and individuals with persistent MHO from childhood to adulthood were not at increased risks of diabetes or LVH.

The area under the curve (AUC) of growth curves was calculated to characterize long‐term burden (total AUC) and trends (incremental AUC) of BMI. Results After adjusting for covariates, higher values of BMI in terms of childhood and adulthood, as well as total and incremental AUC, were strongly associated with elevated levels of adult C‐reactive protein (CRP) in the four race‐sex groups.

Hypothesis: An untargeted metabolomics study will identify novel mechanisms underlying smoking associated weight loss. Methods: We performed cross-sectional analyses among all 248 current smokers and 637 never smokers participated in the Bogalusa Heart Study 2016 survey. After stringent quality control and normalization, 1,202 plasma metabolites were assessed for mediation effects on smoking-BMI association after controlling for age, gender, race, education, drinking and physical activity. The collective mediation effects of metabolites were estimated by comparing the smoking-BMI associations before and after controlling for all significant metabolites after Bonferroni correction. Bidirectional Mendelian randomization analyses were then performed on a subset of participants (n=654) to delineate causal directions among smoking, BMI, and significant metabolites. We constructed multi-locus genetic risk scores (GRS) for smoking and BMI based on findings from published GWASs with a sample size of more than 250,000. Multivariable linear regression controlling for the same covariates as in the mediation analyses was used to estimate associations between smoking- and BMI-GRSs and the significant metabolites. Results: Compared to never smokers, current smokers had a 3.31 kg/m 2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.15-4.47) lower BMI after adjusting for all covariables.

Hypothesis: An untargeted metabolomics study will identify novel mechanisms underlying smoking associated weight loss. Methods: We performed cross-sectional analyses among all 248 current smokers and 637 never smokers participated in the Bogalusa Heart Study 2016 survey. After stringent quality control and normalization, 1,202 plasma metabolites were assessed for mediation effects on smoking-BMI association after controlling for age, gender, race, education, drinking and physical activity. The collective mediation effects of metabolites were estimated by comparing the smoking-BMI associations before and after controlling for all significant metabolites after Bonferroni correction. Bidirectional Mendelian randomization analyses were then performed on a subset of participants (n=654) to delineate causal directions among smoking, BMI, and significant metabolites. We constructed multi-locus genetic risk scores (GRS) for smoking and BMI based on findings from published GWASs with a sample size of more than 250,000. Multivariable linear regression controlling for the same covariates as in the mediation analyses was used to estimate associations between smoking- and BMI-GRSs and the significant metabolites. Results: Compared to never smokers, current smokers had a 3.31 kg/m 2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.15-4.47) lower BMI after adjusting for all covariables. A total of 40 metabolites significantly mediated and explained 90.7% of the smoking-BMI association. Seven of the significant metabolites were associated with smoking GRS but not BMI GRS, suggesting a true mediation role in the smoking-BMI association. The seven metabolites, including homoarginine (mediation beta=-0.49 kg/m 2 , 95% CI: -0.78 to -0.26), 1-oleoyl-GPE (18:1) (mediation beta=-0.44 kg/m 2 , 95% CI: -0.72 to -0.22), 1-linoleoyl-GPE (18:2)* (mediation beta=-0.59 kg/m 2 , 95% CI: -0.90 to -0.32), beta-cryptoxanthin (mediation beta=0.53 kg/m 2 , 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.83), 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPE (18:0/20:4) (mediation beta=0.39 kg/m 2 , 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.65), sphingomyelin (d18:2/21:0, d16:2/23:0)* (mediation beta=-0.54 kg/m 2 , 95% CI: -0.84 to -0.28), and sphingomyelin (d17:2/16:0, d18:2/15:0)* (mediation beta=-0.92 kg/m 2 , 95% CI: -1.30 to -0.59), mediated 36.3% of the association between current smoking and BMI.

Hard clustering approach treats the mixed phases as separate independent clusters from their constituent pure phases, hence, resulting in incorrect phase diagrams which complicate the next steps. Here, we present a novel clustering approach of XRD patterns by leveraging a fuzzy clustering technique that can signiﬁcantly enhance the potential phase mapping and reduce the manual efforts involved in XRD analysis. The proposed approach ﬁrst generates an initial composition-phase diagram and initial pure phase representations by applying the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm, followed by hierarchical clustering to accomplish effortless manual merging of similar initial pure phases to generate the ﬁnal composition-phase diagram.

Hard clustering approach treats the mixed phases as separate independent clusters from their constituent pure phases, hence, resulting in incorrect phase diagrams which complicate the next steps. Here, we present a novel clustering approach of XRD patterns by leveraging a fuzzy clustering technique that can signiﬁcantly enhance the potential phase mapping and reduce the manual efforts involved in XRD analysis. The proposed approach ﬁrst generates an initial composition-phase diagram and initial pure phase representations by applying the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm, followed by hierarchical clustering to accomplish effortless manual merging of similar initial pure phases to generate the ﬁnal composition-phase diagram. The proposed method is evaluated on the XRD samples from two high-throughput composition-spread experiments of Co-Ni-Ta and Co-Ti-Ta ternary alloy systems. Our results demonstrate signiﬁcant improvement compared to hard clustering and almost completely eliminate manual efforts.",3

Interfaces in machinery subjected to vibrations are difficult to study due to limited experimental data on contact states like stick, slip, and separation. To address this, we exploit solitary waves in granular crystals as a novel method to monitor friction in vibrating surfaces. Solitary waves exist in nonlinear media and are highly sensitive to contact mechanics due to their localized point contact and short interaction timescales. Their sensitivity to boundary conditions, short interaction timescales, and localized point contact suggest the potential for nondestructive evaluation of friction, offering advantages over conventional ultrasonic techniques. This study focuses on effects of vibrating frictional interface at the boundary of a chain of rigid spheres and its impact on solitary wave speed. The experiment demands precise control and measurements to address the challenges by solitary waves' sensitivity to contact variations. Experimental results show measurable changes in solitary wave speed during stick, slip, and the evolution of contact parameters by wear, above the noise floor, demonstrating the potential for nondestructive evaluation. Anticipated outcomes include deeper understanding of interfacial mechanics, new characterization tools, and innovative acoustic metamaterials, with implications for industrial and naval applications.","Experimental study of frictional interfaces using solitary waves in 1-D monoatomic granular crystals This research addresses critical challenges in understanding the complex mechanics in frictional interfaces.

The performance of these devices is primarily governed by the capability of the metamaterial to achieve intermodal targeted energy transfer. In this study, we explore phononic metamaterials with strongly nonlinear local resonators that are capable of significant interband targeted energy transfer (IBTET), that is, of nonlinear energy scattering from a primary, high-energetic pass band containing the energy of external excitation to higher- or lower-frequency secondary bands. The nonlinearity arises from pronounced geometric effects, specifically from the inclusion of local (internal) resonators with inclined linear stiffnesses. This geometric arrangement can exhibit characteristics such as softening-hardening nonlinearity and bistability, contingent upon the initial angle of inclination where the local resonator is at equilibrium. We conducted numerical simulations on a one-dimensional (1D) semi-infinite phononic lattice (modeled as a 1D lattice composed of a large number of coupled oscillators, possessing free boundaries) with varied distributions of nonlinearity and different initial angles of inclination of the internal resonators. The results demonstrate that the system exhibits robust IBTET at specific wave amplitudes. Furthermore, we show that strong nonlinearity can profoundly influence the bandgap topology under specific parameters. This band alteration can induce wave arrest and localization within the nonlinear phononic lattice and give rise to phenomena such as negative group velocity and break of acoustic reciprocity. To provide quantitative measures for the efficacy of the nonlinear phononic lattice for IBTET and wave manipulation, we quantify the induced nonlinear energy scattering across different bands using a wavelet-based technique, which on broader context, is valid for decomposition of multiscale acoustics in general classes of acoustic waveguide.

SHG analysis identified significant disorganization in collagen fibril orientation in the circumferential layer and heterogeneous distribution of regions with elevated forward to backward ratios (F/B) across all uterine layers due to PP exposure. High F/B can indicate multiple potential fibril-level changes like thickened fibrils, higher crosslinking, fibril disorganization - changes not fully decipherable by SHG alone. Recognizing this limitation, the study employs NI and AFM to provide complementary mechanical and nanoscale insights. NI revealed increased indentation modulus in the exposed uteri, suggesting increased stiffness. Co-registration of the indentation response with SHG parameters uncovered that elevated F/B regions show enhanced mechanical stiffness, suggesting a fibrotic transformation following PP exposure.

This approach confirmed the presence of disordered and entangled collagen fibrils in the circumferential layer in all regions and an increase in fibril diameter in the high F/B regions in the exposed uteri.

SHG analysis identified significant disorganization in collagen fibril orientation in the circumferential layer and heterogeneous distribution of regions with elevated forward to backward ratios (F/B) across all uterine layers due to PP exposure. High F/B can indicate multiple potential fibril-level changes like thickened fibrils, higher crosslinking, fibril disorganization - changes not fully decipherable by SHG alone. Recognizing this limitation, the study employs NI and AFM to provide complementary mechanical and nanoscale insights. NI revealed increased indentation modulus in the exposed uteri, suggesting increased stiffness. Co-registration of the indentation response with SHG parameters uncovered that elevated F/B regions show enhanced mechanical stiffness, suggesting a fibrotic transformation following PP exposure.

How does BMP-2 operate a switch in adhesive machinery to adapt to the new microenvironment and to drive bone cell fate is not well understood. Here, we addressed this question for BMP-2 delivered either in solution or physically bound of a biomimetic film, to mimic its presentation to cells via the extracellular matrix (ECM). Methods: Biommetics films were prepared using a recently developed automated method that enable high content studies of cellular processes. Comparative gene expressions were done using RNA sequencing from the encyclopedia of the regulatory elements (ENCODE). Gene expressions of transcription factors, beta chain (1, 3, 5) integrins and cadherins (M, N, and Cad11) were studied using quantitative PCR. ECM proteins and adhesion receptor expressions were also quantified by Western blots and dot blots. Their spatial organization in and around cells was studied using immuno-stainings. The individual effect of each receptor on osteogenic transcription factors and alkaline phosphatase expression were studied using silencing RNA of each integrin and cadherin receptor. The organization of fibronectin was studied using immuno-staining and quantitative microscopic analysis. Results: Our findings highlight a switch of integrin and cadherin expression during muscle to bone transdifferentiation upon BMP-2 stimulation. This switch occurs no matter the presentation mode, for BMP-2 presented in solution or via the biomimetic film. While C2C12 muscle cells express M-cadherin and Laminin-specific integrins, the BMP-2-induced transdifferentiation into bone cells is associated with an increase in the expression of cadherin-11 and collagen-specific integrins. Biomimetic films presenting matrix-bound BMP-2 enable the revelation of specific roles of the adhesive receptors depending on the transcription factor. Discussion: While β3 integrin and cadherin-11 work in concert to control early pSMAD1,5,9 signaling, β1 integrin and Cadherin-11 control RunX2, ALP activity and fibronectin organization around the cells. In contrast, while β1 integrin is also important for osterix transcriptional activity, Cadherin-11 and β5 integrin act as negative osterix regulators. In addition, β5 integrin negatively regulates RunX2. Our results show that biomimetic films can be used to delinate the specific events associated with BMP-2-mediated muscle to bone transdifferentiation. Our study reveals how integrins and cadherins work together, while exerting distinct functions to drive osteogenic programming. Different sets of integrins and cadherins have complementary mechanical roles during the time window of this transdifferentiation.","Interplay between integrins and cadherins to control bone differentiation upon BMP-2 stimulation Introduction: Upon BMP-2 stimulation, the osteoblastic lineage commitment in C2C12 myoblasts is associated with a microenvironmental change that occurs over several days.

Because of the extensive production and use of phthalates, humans are exposed to these chemicals daily. While most studies focus on a single phthalate, humans are exposed to a mixture of phthalates on a regular basis. The impact of continuous exposure to phthalate mixture on uterus is largely unknown. Thus, we conducted studies in which adult female mice were exposed for 6 months to 0.15 ppm and 1.5 ppm of a mixture of phthalates containing di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, di-iso-nonyl phthalate, benzyl butyl phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate, diisobutyl phthalate, and diethyl phthalate via chow ad libitum. Our studies revealed that consumption of phthalate mixture at 0.15 ppm and 1.5 ppm for 6 months led to a significant increase in the thickness of the myometrial layer compared to control. Further investigation employing RNA-sequencing revealed an elevated transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling in the uteri of mice fed with phthalate mixture. TGF-β signaling is associated with the development of fibrosis, a consequence of excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix components, such as collagen fibers in a tissue. Consistent with this observation, we found a higher incidence of collagen deposition in uteri of mice exposed to phthalate mixture compared to unexposed controls. Second Harmonic Generation imaging showed disorganized collagen fibers and an increase in uterine stiffness upon exposure to phthalate mixture. Collectively, our results demonstrate that chronic exposure to phthalate mixture can have adverse effects on uterine homeostasis.","Chronic exposure of mice to phthalates enhances TGF beta signaling and promotes uterine fibrosis Phthalates are synthetic chemicals widely used as plasticizers and stabilizers in various consumer products.

This paper establishes the potential for inorganic cues to complement these known biochemical effects. Settlement substrates were fabricated from calcium carbonate, a material present naturally on reefs, and modified with additives including sands, glasses, and alkaline earth carbonates. Experiments with larvae of two Caribbean coral species revealed additive-specific settlement preferences that were independent of bulk surface properties such as mean roughness and wettability. Instead, analyses of the substrates suggest that settling coral larvae can detect localized topographical features more than an order of magnitude smaller than their body width and can sense and positively respond to soluble inorganic minerals such as silica (SiO2) and strontianite (SrCO3). These findings open a new area of research in coral reef restoration, in which composite substrates can be designed with a combination of natural organic and inorganic additives to increase larval settlement and perhaps also improve post-settlement growth, mineralization, and defense.","Composite Substrates Reveal Inorganic Material Cues for Coral Larval Settlement The widespread loss of stony reef-building coral populations has been compounded by the low settlement and survival of coral juveniles.

 For large initial rectilinear displacements, we investigate free response of a linear oscillator inertially coupled to a rotational nonlinear energy sink (NES). Absent direct rectilinear damping, two ranges of orbitally stable solutions are accessible, in contrast to one range at lower, intermediate energies (2021, J. Appl. Mech. 88, 121009). As at lower initial energies, fractal and riddled basins of attraction are identified for both previously considered numerical combinations of the two dimensionless parameters (characterizing rotational damping, and coupling of rotational to rectilinear motion). In this case, however, the final amplitude, in addition to the final angular orientation, displays initial-condition sensitivity. For one parameter combination, most motionless initial conditions (MICs, with the masses of the linear oscillator and NES both initially at rest) lead to a discrete set of ""special"" orbitally stable solutions with one of two amplitudes, and no MICs lead to complete dissipation of initial energy. For the other combination, the results are similar to those at intermediate initial energies, with no MICs leading to special solutions, and many leading to complete dissipation. Results for both parameter combinations strongly suggest that no qualitatively new behavior occurs for initial energies beyond those considered here, with nonrotating asymptotic special-amplitude solutions having larger rectilinear amplitude either not existing or existing in only very small parts of the MIC space. With direct damping of rectilinear motion, transient chaos leads to initial-condition sensitivity of settling time, with the case of no direct rectilinear damping providing good guidance to damped-case behavior.","Free Response of a Rotational Nonlinear Energy Sink Coupled to a Linear Oscillator: Fractality, Riddling, and Initial-Condition Sensitivity at Large Initial Displacements For large initial rectilinear displacements, we investigate free response of a linear oscillator inertially coupled to a rotational nonlinear energy sink (NES).

ABSTRACT Chitin is a natural N-acetylglucosamine polymer and a major structural component of fungal cell walls. Dietary chitin is mucoadhesive; anti-inflammatory effects of chitin microparticles (CMPs; 1- to 10-μm diameters) have been demonstrated in models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The goals of this study were to assess (i) whether CMPs among various chitin preparations are the most effective against colitis in male and female mice and (ii) whether host chitin-binding Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and CD14 are required for the anti-inflammatory effect of chitin. We found that colitis in male mice was ameliorated by CMPs and large chitin beads (LCBs; 40 to 70 μm) but not by chitosan (deacetylated chitin) microparticles, oligosaccharide chitin, or glucosamine. In fact, LCBs were more effective than CMPs. In female colitis, on the other hand, CMPs and LCBs were equally and highly effective. Neither sex of TLR2-deficient mice showed anti-inflammatory effects when treated with LCBs. No anti-inflammatory effect of LCBs was seen in either CD14-deficient males or females. Furthermore, an in vitro study indicated that when LCBs and CMPs were digested with stomach acidic mammalian chitinase (AMC), their size-dependent macrophage activations were modified, at least in part, suggesting reduced particle sizes of dietary chitin in the stomach. Interestingly, stomach AMC activity was greater in males than females. Our results indicated that dietary LCBs were the most effective preparation for treating colitis in both sexes; these anti-inflammatory effects of LCBs were dependent on host TLR2 and CD14.","Dietary Chitin Particles Called Mimetic Fungi Ameliorate Colitis in Toll-Like Receptor 2/CD14- and Sex-Dependent Manners Chitin is a natural N-acetylglucosamine polymer and a major structural component of fungal cell walls.

Fouling of injection well tubing by biofilm or scale is common and reduces the effective diameter of the pipe, which results in increased wellhead pressure and lower injectivity. A detailed microbiological composition of biofilms and abiotic fingerprints use of mineral scale from an injection well has not been reported before. Therefore, biofilm and mineral scale samples from three depth intervals within a deep injection well (surface zone, D1= 0 - 61 m; intermediate zone, D2 = 62 - 457 m; and above the injection zone, D3 = 458 - 884 m) with recurrent biofilm development were collected to characterize the mineral composition and microbial community DNA. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the solids confirms the composition of the solids collected was mostly calcium carbonate (CaCO3) with minor contributions from common mineral salts. Microbiological fingerprinting suggests that methanogenic archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria both of which are anaerobic biofilm producers were the most prevalent members of the prokaryotic community at all sampled depths. Methanosarcinae spp. increased with increasing depths, unlike other archaea. A non-pathogenic biofilm-producing Entamoeba dispar was the most prevalent member of the microbial domain (>30%) in all samples but was highest at the middle depth. The Chao alpha diversity indices for bacteria, viruses, and protozoans were highest at the shallow depth and gradually declined with increasing depth. The prevalent species above the injection zone depth are not barophilic organisms that thrive at high pressures, rather they are sulfate-reducing bacteria involved in anaerobic dissimilatory sulfate metabolism.","Characterization of Biofilms and Mineralogical Scale in Underground Injection Well Disposal of Landfill Leachate and Industrial Wastewater Streams Deep-well injection is a cost-effective alternative for industrial wastewater disposal, given the appropriate geology.

ABSTRACT Chitin is a natural N-acetylglucosamine polymer and a major structural component of fungal cell walls. Dietary chitin is mucoadhesive; anti-inflammatory effects of chitin microparticles (CMPs; 1- to 10-μm diameters) have been demonstrated in models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The goals of this study were to assess (i) whether CMPs among various chitin preparations are the most effective against colitis in male and female mice and (ii) whether host chitin-binding Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and CD14 are required for the anti-inflammatory effect of chitin. We found that colitis in male mice was ameliorated by CMPs and large chitin beads (LCBs; 40 to 70 μm) but not by chitosan (deacetylated chitin) microparticles, oligosaccharide chitin, or glucosamine. In fact, LCBs were more effective than CMPs. In female colitis, on the other hand, CMPs and LCBs were equally and highly effective. Neither sex of TLR2-deficient mice showed anti-inflammatory effects when treated with LCBs. No anti-inflammatory effect of LCBs was seen in either CD14-deficient males or females. Furthermore, an in vitro study indicated that when LCBs and CMPs were digested with stomach acidic mammalian chitinase (AMC), their size-dependent macrophage activations were modified, at least in part, suggesting reduced particle sizes of dietary chitin in the stomach. Interestingly, stomach AMC activity was greater in males than females. Our results indicated that dietary LCBs were the most effective preparation for treating colitis in both sexes; these anti-inflammatory effects of LCBs were dependent on host TLR2 and CD14.","Dietary Chitin Particles Called Mimetic Fungi Ameliorate Colitis in Toll-Like Receptor 2/CD14- and Sex-Dependent Manners Chitin is a natural N-acetylglucosamine polymer and a major structural component of fungal cell walls.

They can be used in the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents in vivo, in the hyperthermic treatment of cancers, in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging as contrast agents and in the biomagnetic separations of biomolecules. In this study, a characterization of the movement and heating of three different types of magnetic nanoparticles in physiological systems in vitro is made in a known external magnetic field and alternating field respectively. Infra-red (IR) imaging and MR imaging were used to visualize these nanoparticles in vitro. A strong dependence on the size and the suspending medium is observed on the movement and heating of these nanoparticles. First, two of the particles (mean diameter d = 10 nm, uncoated Fe3O4 and d = 2.8 µm, polystyrene coated Fe3O4+γ-Fe2O3) did not move while only a dextran coated nanoparticle (d = 50 nm, γ-Fe2O3) moved in type 1 collagen used as an in vitro model system. It is also observed that the time taken by a collection of these nanoparticles to move even a smaller distance (5 mm) in collagen (∼100 min) is almost ten times higher when compared to the time taken to move twice the distance (10 mm) in glycerol (∼10 min) under the same external field. Second, the amount of temperature rise increases with the concentration of nanoparticles regardless of the microenvironments in the heating studies. However, the amount of heating in collagen (maximum change in temperature ΔTmax∼9 °C at 1.9 mg Fe ml−1 and 19 °C at 3.7 mg Fe ml−1) is significantly less than that in water (ΔTmax∼15 °C at 1.9 mg Fe ml−1 and 33 °C at 3.7 mg Fe ml−1) and glycerol (ΔTmax∼13.5 °C at 1.9 mg Fe ml−1 and 30 °C at 3.7 mg Fe ml−1). Further, IR imaging provides at least a ten times improvement in the range of imaging magnetic nanoparticles, whereby a concentration of (0–4 mg Fe ml−1) could bevisualized as compared to (0–0.4 mg Fe ml−1) by MR imaging. Based on these in vitro studies, important issues and parameters that require further understanding and characterization of these nanoparticles in vivo are discussed.","In vitro characterization of movement, heating and visualization of magnetic nanoparticles for biomedical applications Magnetic nanoparticles can be used for a variety of biomedical applications.

However, the amount of heating in collagen (maximum change in temperature ΔTmax∼9 °C at 1.9 mg Fe ml−1 and 19 °C at 3.7 mg Fe ml−1) is significantly less than that in water (ΔTmax∼15 °C at 1.9 mg Fe ml−1 and 33 °C at 3.7 mg Fe ml−1) and glycerol (ΔTmax∼13.5 °C at 1.9 mg Fe ml−1 and 30 °C at 3.7 mg Fe ml−1). Further, IR imaging provides at least a ten times improvement in the range of imaging magnetic nanoparticles, whereby a concentration of (0–4 mg Fe ml−1) could bevisualized as compared to (0–0.4 mg Fe ml−1) by MR imaging. Based on these in vitro studies, important issues and parameters that require further understanding and characterization of these nanoparticles in vivo are discussed.",3

We perform a systematic analysis of the impact of a wide range of surfactant properties, including elasticity, bulk surfactant concentration, solubility, and diffusivity, on the bubble and flow dynamics in the presence of inertial effects. The results show that the introduction of surfactants is effective in suppressing the tail undulations as they tend to accumulate near the bubble tail.

Analyzing cartilage deformation during walking would provide spatial maps of displacement, strain, and enable viscoelastic characterization, which may serve as imaging biomarkers for early cartilage degeneration when the damage is still reversible. However, the time-dependent biomechanics of cartilage is not well described, and how defects in the joint impact the viscoelastic response is unclear. Methods We used spiral acquisition with displacement encoding MRI to quantify displacement and strain maps at a high frame rate (40 ms; 25 frames/sec) in tibiofemoral joints. We also employed relaxometry methods (T1, T1ρ, T2, T2*) on the cartilage. Results Normal and shear strains were concentrated on the tibiofemoral contact area during loading, and the defected joint exhibited larger compressive strains. We also determined a positive correlation between the change of T1ρ in cartilage after cyclic loading and increased compressive strain on the defected joint. Viscoelastic behavior was quantified by the time-dependent displacement, where the damaged joint showed increased creep behavior compared to the intact. Conclusions Our results indicate that spiral scanning with displacement encoding can quantitatively differentiate the damaged from intact joint using the strain and creep response. The viscoelastic response identified with this methodology could serve as biomarkers to detect defects in joints in vivo and facilitate the early diagnosis of joint diseases such as osteoarthritis.","High-frame-rate analysis of knee cartilage deformation by spiral dualMRI and relaxation mapping ABSTRACT Purpose Daily activities including walking impose high frequency cyclic forces on cartilage and repetitive compressive deformation.

We show that the minimum in the thermal conductivity arises from a competition between lattice dispersion and anharmonic effects such as interface scattering. The initial reduction of thermal conductivity can partially be accounted for by harmonic wave effects induced by interfacial modulation, such as the opening of phononic band gaps and reduction of group velocity. Beyond the minimum, reduced inelastic interface scattering is responsible for the recovery.

However, generalized relationships between ion transport and vibrational dynamics remain elusive due to the diversity of superionic materials and complex underlying mechanisms. Here, the links between vibrational dynamics and ion transport in close‐packed lithium halide ion conductor Li 3 YCl 6 (LYC) are examined using a suite of atomistic first‐principles methods. It is shown that configurational disorder, lattice anharmonicity, and coupled host‐mobile ion vibrational dynamics together induce a transition to the superionic state. Statistical correlations between ionic hops and activation of the distribution of vibrational modes are found. However, typical phenomena associated with superionic conductors such as selective breakdown of zone‐boundary soft phonons, or long wavelength transverse acoustic modes as in the ‘phonon‐liquid‐electron crystal’ concept, are not present. Instead, anharmonic zone‐boundary modes aiding Li diffusion are found to broaden and soften selectively but persist across the superionic transition. These anharmonic modes couple Li ion motion with the vibrations of the flexible close‐packed anion framework, which remains stable and facilitates ionic hopping. The results provide insights into how configurational disorder and soft‐yet‐resilient vibrational modes enable ionic hopping, particularly in 3D close‐packed crystals.","Configurational Disorder, Strong Anharmonicity, and Coupled Host Dynamics Lead to Superionic Transport in Li3YCl6 (LYC) Abstract In superionic crystals, liquid‐like ionic diffusivities often come hand‐in‐hand with ultra‐low thermal conductivity and soft vibrational dynamics.

Here, the links between vibrational dynamics and ion transport in close‐packed lithium halide ion conductor Li 3 YCl 6 (LYC) are examined using a suite of atomistic first‐principles methods. It is shown that configurational disorder, lattice anharmonicity, and coupled host‐mobile ion vibrational dynamics together induce a transition to the superionic state. Statistical correlations between ionic hops and activation of the distribution of vibrational modes are found. However, typical phenomena associated with superionic conductors such as selective breakdown of zone‐boundary soft phonons, or long wavelength transverse acoustic modes as in the ‘phonon‐liquid‐electron crystal’ concept, are not present. Instead, anharmonic zone‐boundary modes aiding Li diffusion are found to broaden and soften selectively but persist across the superionic transition. These anharmonic modes couple Li ion motion with the vibrations of the flexible close‐packed anion framework, which remains stable and facilitates ionic hopping. The results provide insights into how configurational disorder and soft‐yet‐resilient vibrational modes enable ionic hopping, particularly in 3D close‐packed crystals.",3

Foot-drop is due to a disruption of the motor control pathway and may occur in numerous pathologies such as stroke, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and cerebral palsy. The objectives for the prototype PhAFO are to provide toe clearance during swing, permit free ankle motion during stance, and harvest the needed power with an underfoot bellow pump pressurized during the stance phase of walking. Methods The PhAFO was constructed from a two-part (tibia and foot) carbon composite structure with an articulating ankle joint. Ankle motion control was accomplished through a cam-follower locking mechanism actuated via a pneumatic circuit connected to the bellow pump and embedded in the foam sole. Biomechanical performance of the prototype orthosis was assessed during multiple trials of treadmill walking of an able-bodied control subject (n = 1). Motion capture and pressure measurements were used to investigate the effect of the PhAFO on lower limb joint behavior and the capacity of the bellow pump to repeatedly generate the required pneumatic pressure for toe clearance. Results Toe clearance during swing was successfully achieved during all trials; average clearance 44 ± 5 mm. Free ankle motion was observed during stance and plantarflexion was blocked during swing. In addition, the bellow component repeatedly generated an average of 169 kPa per step of pressure during ten minutes of walking. Conclusion This study demonstrated that fluid power could be harvested with a pneumatic circuit built into an AFO, and used to operate an actuated cam-lock mechanism that controls ankle-foot motion at specific periods of the gait cycle.","A pneumatic power harvesting ankle-foot orthosis to prevent foot-drop Abstract Background A self-contained, self-controlled, pneumatic power harvesting ankle-foot orthosis (PhAFO) to manage foot-drop was developed and tested.

Two hardware platforms and analytical models were developed to test design and control methodologies. The full-scale ballbot prototype (MiaPURE) was constructed using off-the-shelf components and designed to have agility, footprint, and balance similar to that of a walking human. The planar inverted pendulum testbed (PIPTB) was developed as a reduced-order testbed for quick validation of system performance. We then proposed a simple yet robust cascaded LQR-PI controller to balance and maneuver the ballbot drivetrain with a heavy payload. This is crucial because the drivetrain is often subject to high stiction due to elastomeric components in the torque transmission system. This controller was first tested in the PIPTB to compare with traditional LQR and cascaded PI-PD controllers, and then implemented in the ballbot drivetrain. The MiaPURE drivetrain was able to carry a payload of 60 kg, achieve a maximum speed of 2.3 m/s, and come to a stop from a speed of 1.4 m/s in 2 seconds in a selected translation direction. Finally, we demonstrated the omnidirectional movement of the ballbot drivetrain in an indoor environment as a payload-carrying robot and a human-riding mobility device.

Cardiology fellows and cardiologists that are new to TP currently train on patients to develop this skill, resulting in increased risk of complications. The goal of this work was to create low-risk training opportunities for new TP operators. Methods: We developed a Soft Active Transseptal Puncture Simulator (SATPS), designed to match the dynamics, static response, and visualization of the heart during TP.

(iii) A simulated intracardiac echocardiography environment provides live visual feedback. Subsystem performance was verified with benchtop tests. Face and content validity were evaluated by experienced clinicians. Results: Subsystems accurately represented atrial volume displacement, tenting and puncture force, and FO deformation.

The mixing of orbitals with distinct parity representations, such as s and p orbitals, has been shown to be useful for generating systems that require alternating phase patterns, as with the sign of couplings within a lattice. Here we show that by breaking the symmetries of such mixed-orbital lattices, it is possible to generate synthetic magnetic flux threading the lattice. We use this insight to experimentally demonstrate quadrupole topological insulators in two-dimensional photonic lattices, leveraging both s and p orbital-type modes.

The mixing of orbitals with distinct parity representations, such as s and p orbitals, has been shown to be useful for generating systems that require alternating phase patterns, as with the sign of couplings within a lattice. Here we show that by breaking the symmetries of such mixed-orbital lattices, it is possible to generate synthetic magnetic flux threading the lattice. We use this insight to experimentally demonstrate quadrupole topological insulators in two-dimensional photonic lattices, leveraging both s and p orbital-type modes.

A two-dimensional model assuming linear elastic behavior is used to analyze an isolated arc shaped island with elastic properties similar to those of the substrate. The substrate is assumed to be much larger than the island. Finite element analysis shows that in order to minimize the total energy, which consists of strain energy, surface energy, and film/substrate interface energy, a coherent island will adopt a particular height-to-width aspect ratio that is a function of only the island volume. It is then shown that for an island with volume greater than a certain critical size, the inclusion of a mismatch strain relieving edge dislocation is favorable.

This design-by-stacking has opened up the promising area of moiré engineering, a term that can be understood in two different perspectives, namely, (i) structural—engineering a moiré pattern by introducing twist, relative strain, or defects that affect the commensurability of the layers and (ii) functional—exploiting a moiré pattern to find and tune resulting physical properties of a vdW heterostructure. The latter meaning, referring to the application of a moiré pattern, is seen in the literature in the specific context of the observation of correlated electronic states and unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene. The former meaning, referring to the design of the moiré pattern itself, is present in the literature but less commonly discussed or less understood. The underlying link between these two perspectives lies in the deformation field of the moiré superlattice. In this Perspective, we describe a path from designing a moiré pattern to employing the moiré pattern to tune physical properties of a vdW heterostructure. We also discuss the concept of moiré engineering in the context of twistronics, strain engineering, and defect engineering in vdW heterostructures. Although twistronics is always associated with moiré superlattices, strain and defect engineering are often not.

Sun et al. have reported low energy barrier (0.5 eV to 0.6 eV) reaction pathways for epoxy groups to form point defects through the formation of surface groups such as lactone-ethers and ether-lactone-ethers. A key feature of our model is that it uses this approach to initiate defects from a defect free surface. The expansion of these point defects is simulated through several reactions that produce CO molecules from the edges of defects. Schmitt has collected and listed several reactions for the formation of CO from different types of defect edge sites, and the majority of these reactions are adopted in the present work. Simulations based on our KMC model reveal details of the pitting process that are dependent on the temperature and pressure. Our simulations reveal a change in defect shape from circular to a branched as the temperature increases from 1300K to 2000K. We also note that the increase in carbon removal rate with temperature is more significant than the increase in the carbon removal rate with pressure, and we report these rates for each temperature and pressure combination. In this work we also elucidate the role of epoxy diffusion in defect formation. We find that the contribution of epoxy groups in forming CO at the edges of defects increases as the temperature increases due to increased epoxy adsorption and diffusion at higher temperatures. The atomistic KMC model can easily reach milliseconds of physical simulation time on a laptop computer, and thus, it can be efficiently used as a tool to understand how various other atomistic reactions affect defect formation in multi-layer graphene.","Atomistic Multi-Lattice Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) Modeling of Hyperthermal Oxidation of Multi-Layer Graphene View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-1610.vid An atomic scale multi-lattice Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model is developed to understand defect generation in multi-layered graphene, instigated by the adsorption and diffusion of epoxy groups on the surface.

However, manufacturing defects intrinsic to AM can affect material properties, limiting the applicability of a uniform material model across diverse cross-sections. To examine this phenomenon, this paper explores the influence of specimen size and layer height on the compressive modulus of polycarbonate (PC) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) specimens fabricated using fused filament fabrication (FFF). Micro-computed tomography imaging and compression testing were conducted on the printed samples. The results indicate that while variations in the modulus were statistically significant due to both layer height and size of the specimen in TPU, variations in PC were only statistically significant due to layer height. The highest elastic modulus was observed at a 0.2 mm layer height for both materials across different sizes. These findings offer valuable insights into design components for FFF, emphasizing the importance of considering mechanical property variations due to feature size, especially in TPU. Furthermore, locations with a higher probability of failure are recommended to be printed closer to the print bed, especially for TPU, because of the lower void volume fraction observed near the heated print bed.","Exploring the Effect of Specimen Size on Elastic Properties of Fused-Filament-Fabrication-Printed Polycarbonate and Thermoplastic Polyurethane Additive manufacturing (AM) is often used to create designs inspired by topology optimization and biological structures, yielding unique cross-sectional geometries spanning across scales.

The composite mechanical properties and failure modes were studied experimentally using uniaxial compression and four‐point bending tests.

Here we provide a comprehensive review of thermal transport research on two actinide oxides: one currently in use in commercial nuclear reactors, uranium dioxide (UO<sub>2</sub>), and one advanced fuel candidate material, thorium dioxide (ThO<sub>2</sub>). In both materials, heat is carried by lattice waves or phonons. Crystalline defects caused by fission events effectively scatter phonons and lead to a degradation in fuel performance over time. Bolstered by new computational and experimental tools, researchers are now developing the foundational work necessary to accurately model and ultimately control thermal transport in advanced nuclear fuels. We begin by reviewing research aimed at understanding thermal transport in perfect single crystals. The absence of defects enables studies that focus on the fundamental aspects of phonon transport. Next, we review research that targets defect generation and evolution. Here the focus is on ion irradiation studies used as surrogates for damage caused by fission products. We end this review with a discussion of modeling and experimental efforts directed at predicting and validating mesoscale thermal transport in the presence of irradiation defects. While efforts in these research areas have been robust, challenging work remains in developing holistic tools to capture and predict thermal energy transport across widely varying environmental conditions.","Thermal Energy Transport in Oxide Nuclear Fuel.

In this study, the mechanisms of damage production and annihilation due to primary knock-on atom collisions are investigated for amorphous interphase and grain boundaries in a Cu-Ta alloy using atomistic simulations. Amorphous complexions, in particular amorphous interphase complexions that separate Cu and Ta grains, result in less residual defect damage than their ordered counterparts.

But, like other austenitic steels, D9 is susceptible to irradiation-induced clustering of Ni and Si, the mechanism for which is not well understood. This study utilizes atom probe tomography (APT) to characterize the chemistry and morphology of Ni–Si nanoclusters in D9 following neutron or proton irradiation to doses ranging from 5–9 displacements per atom (dpa) and temperatures ranging from 430–683 °C. Nanoclusters form only after neutron irradiation and exhibit classical coarsening with increasing dose and temperature. The nanoclusters have Ni3Si stoichiometry in a Ni core–Si shell structure. This core–shell structure provides insight into a potentially unique nucleation and growth mechanism—nanocluster cores may nucleate through local, spinodal-like compositional fluctuations in Ni, with subsequent growth driven by rapid Si diffusion.

However, such an informal mechanism is weakened by the prevalent social norms of son preference and is also less effective among emerging only‐child households.

In this study, we found high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) and TLRs were overexpressed in human and rotavirus-induced murine BA. The overexpressed HMGB1 released from the nuclei of rotavirus-infected cholangiocytes, as well as macrophages, activated hepatic NK cells via HMGB1-TLRs-MAPK signaling pathways. Immature NK cells had low cytotoxicity on rotavirus-injured cholangiocytes due to low expression of TLRs, which caused persistent rotavirus infection in bile ducts. HMGB1 up-regulated the levels of TLRs of NK cells and promoted NK cell activation in an age-dependent fashion. As NK cells gained increasing activation as mice aged, they gained increasing cytotoxicity on rotavirus-infected cholangiocytes, which finally caused BA. Adult NK cells eliminated rotavirus-infected cholangiocytes shortly after infection, which prevented persistent rotavirus infection in bile ducts. Moreover, adoptive transfer of mature NK cells prior to rotavirus infection decreased the incidence of BA in newborn mice.

Studies have shown that more than 20 genes are involved in HSCR, and most cases of HSCR are sporadic. However, the overall rate of familial recurrence in 4331 cases of HSCR is about 7.6%. Furthermore, familial HSCR patients show incomplete dominance. We still do not know the penetrance and genetic characteristics of these known risk genes due to the rarity of HSCR families. Methods To find published references, we used the title/abstract terms “Hirschsprung” and “familial” in the PubMed database and the MeSH terms “Hirschsprung” and “familial” in Web of Science. Finally, we summarized 129 HSCR families over the last 40 years. Results The male-to-female ratio and the percentage of short segment-HSCR in familial HSCR are much lower than in sporadic HSCR. The primary gene factors in the syndromic families are ret proto-oncogene ( RET ) and endothelin B receptor gene ( EDNRB ). Most families show incomplete dominance and are relevant to RET , and the RET mutation has 56% penetrance in familial HSCR. When one of the parents is a RET mutation carrier in an HSCR family, the offspring’s recurrence risk is 28%, and the incidence of the offspring does not depend on whether the parent suffers from HSCR. Conclusion Our findings will help HSCR patients obtain better genetic counseling, calculate the risk of recurrence, and provide new insights for future pedigree studies.","Comprehensive characterization of the genetic landscape of familial Hirschsprung’s disease Background Hirschsprung’s disease (HSCR) is one of the most common congenital digestive tract malformations and can cause stubborn constipation or gastrointestinal obstruction after birth, causing great physical and mental pain to patients and their families.

Methods To find published references, we used the title/abstract terms “Hirschsprung” and “familial” in the PubMed database and the MeSH terms “Hirschsprung” and “familial” in Web of Science. Finally, we summarized 129 HSCR families over the last 40 years. Results The male-to-female ratio and the percentage of short segment-HSCR in familial HSCR are much lower than in sporadic HSCR. The primary gene factors in the syndromic families are ret proto-oncogene ( RET ) and endothelin B receptor gene ( EDNRB ). Most families show incomplete dominance and are relevant to RET , and the RET mutation has 56% penetrance in familial HSCR. When one of the parents is a RET mutation carrier in an HSCR family, the offspring’s recurrence risk is 28%, and the incidence of the offspring does not depend on whether the parent suffers from HSCR. Conclusion Our findings will help HSCR patients obtain better genetic counseling, calculate the risk of recurrence, and provide new insights for future pedigree studies.",8

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), one of the most common digested tract malformations, shows peristaltic dysfunction and spasm smooth muscles. The arrangement of the circular and longitudinal smooth muscle (SM) of the aganglionic segments is disorganized. Does ACTA2, as a marker of iSMCs, exhibit abnormal expression in aganglionic segments? Does the ACTA2 expression level affect the contraction function of iSMCs? What are the spatiotemporal expression trends of ACTA2 during different developmental stages of the colon? Methods Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the expression of ACTA2 in iSMCs of children with HSCR and Ednrb ^ −/− mice, and the small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) knockdown technique was employed to investigate how Acta2 affected the systolic function of iSMCs. Additionally, Ednrb ^ −/− mice were used to explore the changes in the expression level of iSMCs ACTA2 at different developmental stages. Results The expression of ACTA2 is higher in circular SM in the aganglionic segments of HSCR patients and Ednrb ^ −/− mice than in normal control children and mice.

The prompt use of empiric antibiotics is essential due to the lack of identified microorganisms. The authors aimed to validate a severity grading system to guide empiric antibiotic therapy in the management of post-KPE cholangitis. Materials and methods: This multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label study recruited patients with post-KPE cholangitis and was conducted from January 2018 to December 2019. On admission, patients were categorized into mild, moderate, and severe cholangitis according to the severity grading system. Patients in the mild cholangitis group were randomized to receive cefoperazone sodium tazobactam sodium (CSTS) or meropenem (MEPM). Patients with severe cholangitis were randomized to treatment with MEPM or a combination of MEPM plus immunoglobulin (MEPM+IVIG). Patients with moderate cholangitis received MEPM. Results: The primary endpoint was duration of fever (DOF). Secondary outcomes included blood culture, length of hospital stay, incidence of recurrent cholangitis, jaundice clearance rate, and native liver survival (NLS). For mild cholangitis, DOF, and length of hospital stay were similar between those treated with CSTS or MEPM (all P>0.05). In addition, no significant difference in recurrence rate, jaundice clearance rate, and NLS was observed between patients treated with CSTS and MEPM at 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up. In patients with moderate cholangitis, the DOF was 36.00 (interquartile range: 24.00–48.00) h. In severe cholangitis, compared with MEPM, MEPM+IVIG decreased DOF and improved liver function by reducing alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and direct bilirubin at 1-month follow-up. However, recurrence rate, jaundice clearance rate, and NLS did not differ significantly between MEPM+IVIG and MEPM at 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up. Conclusions: In patients with post-KPE cholangitis, MEPM is not superior to CSTS for the treatment of mild cholangitis. However, MEPM+IVIG treatment was associated with better short-term clinical outcomes in patients with severe cholangitis.","Severity assessment to guide empiric antibiotic therapy for cholangitis in children after Kasai portoenterostomy: a multicenter prospective randomized control trial in China Background: Cholangitis is common in patients with biliary atresia following Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE).

The purpose of this study is to further explore the underlying mechanism and biomarkers for the co-occurrence of HSCR and CD. Methods The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was used to obtain gene expression profiles for CD (GSE95095) and HSCR (GSE98502). Following the identification of the shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of CD and HSCR, functional annotation, protein–protein interaction (PPI) network creation, and module assembly were performed to discover hub genes. RT-qPCR was performed to validate the expression of the hub genes in HSCR samples. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was utilized to assess the accuracy of the hub genes as biomarkers in predicting CD in both the training dataset and test dataset. Results A total of 103 common DEGs (50 downregulated genes and 53 upregulated genes) were chosen for further investigation. The importance of chemokines and cytokines in these two disorders is highlighted by functional analysis. MCODE plug identified three important modules, which functionally enriched the immune system process. Finally, nine hub genes were identified using cytoHubba, including IL1B, IL10, CXCL10, ICAM1, EGR1, FCGR3A, S100A12, S100A9, and FPR1.

Methods Three independent gene expression datasets were utilized in this study. Autophagy-related genes (ARG) associated with PFS of NB patients were firstly identified by univariate Cox survival analysis. lncRNAs correlated with those PFS-related ARGs were then identified. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to select out those lncRNAs with the best prognostic value for PFS. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Area Under Curve (AUC) analyses were performed to assess the prediction accuracy. Results Four autophagy-related lncRNAs (AL356599.1, AC022075.1, AC020928.1 and LINC02076) were found to be with the best prognostic value and integrated into a four-lncRNA risk signature for predicting PFS of NB patients. The four-lncRNA signature significantly stratify NB patients into two risk groups, with high-risk group has significantly poorer PFS than the low-risk group. The prognostic role of the lncRNA signature was independent with other clinical risk factors. The ROC curves revealed that the lncRNA signature has a good performance in predicting PFS (AUC > 0.70). A nomogram based on COG (Children’s Oncology Group) risk and the lncRNA risk score was constructed, showing good prediction accuracy (C-index = 0.700). The prognostic ability of the nomogram was better than that of COG risk alone (AUC = 0.790 versus AUC = 0.748). GSEA analyses revealed that multiple autophagy-related gene sets are significantly enriched in the low-risk group. Conclusions We identified an autophagy-related four-lncRNA signature that could help to predict the PFS of NB patients.

The most significant characteristics of aganglionic segments in HSCR are hyperplastic extrinsic nerve fibers and the absence of endogenous ganglion plexus. Double C2 domain alpha (DOC2A) is mainly located in the nucleus and is involved in Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release. The loss function of DOC2A influences postsynaptic protein synthesis, dendrite morphology, postsynaptic receptor density and synaptic plasticity. It is still unknown why hyperplastic extrinsic nerve fibers grow into aganglionic segments in HSCR. We detected the expression of DOC2A in HSCR aganglionic segment colons and established three DOC2A-knockdown models in the Neuro-2a cell line, neural spheres and zebrafish separately. First, we detected the protein and mRNA expression of DOC2A and found that DOC2A was negatively correlated with AChE+ grades. Second, in the Neuro-2a cell lines, we found that the amount of neurite outgrowth and mean area per cell were significantly increased, which suggested that the inhibition of DOC2A promotes nerve fiber formation and the neuron’s polarity. In the neural spheres, we found that the DOC2A knockdown was manifested by a more obvious connection of nerve fibers in neural spheres. Then, we knocked down Doc2a in zebrafish and found that the down-regulation of Doc2a accelerates the formation of hyperplastic nerve fibers in aganglionic segments in zebrafish.

Early surgical removal is advisable, also in asymptomatic patients, because of the risk of inflammatory complications, such as recurrent crissum abscess, and malignant changes. Case presentation A previously healthy 2-year-old boy was evaluated in the emergency department with fever. He complained of anal pain in the absence of incentive. Physical examination and ultrasound confirmed a diagnosis of perianal abscess. He was treated with incision and drainage of the abscess and intravenous antibiotics. Two months after his discharge from the hospital, he developed fever and had intervals discharge pus and pain in the same locations. Colorectal endoscopy revealed that there was no fistula opening at the rectal wall. Intraoperative fistulography showed a fistulous tract that was connected to a subcutaneous cavity. Excision of the fistulous tract and wide drainage of the deep postanal space were performed. The patient was referred to our hospital for further evaluation 6 months later. Physical examination showed a secondary anus that had not been noticed before. MRI showed an anal fistula between 1 and 3 o’clock, and preoperative fistulography revealed a 3-cm-long tubular structure without any connection with the rectum. The diagnosis of ACD was made by intraoperative examination with a metal catheter and the postoperative pathological analysis. The duplicated anal canal was resected completely via a perianal approach without any rectal injury. Histology showed a squamous epithelium in the distal end with some smooth-muscle fibers. After a follow-up of 8 months, the patient has been doing well. Conclusion Recurrent crissum abscess should raise clinical attention to alimentary tract congenital malformations such as ACD. Prompt recognition of these unique presentations of ACD is needed, and complete excision through a perineal approach or posterior sagittal approach is recommended.","Anal Canal Duplication Mimicking Recurrent Abscess: A Case Report and Review of the Literature Background Anal canal duplication (ACD) is a very rare duplication of the gastrointestinal tract and is described as a secondary anal orifice along the posterior side of the normal anal canal.

Como possui um mecanismo de condução de prótons dependente de moléculas de água, estas células têm uma temperatura de operação limitada até 80&amp;deg;C. O aumento da temperatura de operação de uma célula PEMFC é desejado devido à contribuição da temperatura na aceleração das reações eletroquímicas, que são processos termoativados. Neste contexto, as membranas PBI (polibenzimidazol) dopadas com ácido fosfórico têm sido consideradas um polímero base bastante promissor para eletrólitos sólidos operantes em alta temperatura, devido à combinação de condução de prótons satisfatória em condições de baixa umidade relativa e excelente estabilidade térmica. No entanto, membranas baseadas em PBI apresentam algumas desvantagens, tais como lixiviação do ácido (veículo condutor), diminuição de sua resistência mecânica, permeabilidade aos combustíveis utilizados em PEMFC operante em alta temperatura (HT-PEMFC), permitindo que uma parte migre do ânodo para o cátodo da célula (crossover) e diminuindo assim a eficiência e o desempenho global do dispositivo. Neste contexto, o objetivo do trabalho foi o desenvolvimento e otimização de membranas compósitas a base de PBI e óxido de silício (SiO2), que além de atuar como reforço mecânico, pode contribuir na mitigação do crossover e, dessa forma, se apresentar como uma alternativa ao Nafion como eletrólito sólido em células a combustível de etanol direto de alta temperatura (HT-DEFC). Nesse sentido, membranas puras de PBI e compósitos PBI-SiO2 com diferentes frações de SiO2 (2,5%, 5%, e 10%) foram sintetizadas e caracterizadas por Raman, termogravimetria, microscopia eletrônica de varredura e espectroscopia de impedância eletroquímica. Por fim, as membranas foram avaliadas em protótipos de HT-DEFC a 180&amp;deg;C após parametrização e otimização dos componentes dos conjuntos eletrodos-membranas (MEA). Ainda, eletrocatalisadores anódicos baseados em Pt/C, PtSn/C e PtRu/C foram estudados com o objetivo de avaliar o efeito da natureza do catalisador no desempenho de HT-DEFCs.\n","Desenvolvimento de membranas não fluoradas a base de PBI para aplicação em células a combustível de etanol direto de alta temperatura \n A maioria das células a combustível de membrana de troca protônica (PEMFC) utiliza o Nafion&amp;reg; como eletrólito.

Para contribuir com esse campo, esse artigo faz um estudo de caso dos candidatos a vereadores do Partido NOVO nas eleições de 2020. Para tanto, questionamos qual foi o método de financiamento mais utilizado, bem como se há algum padrão no custo por voto de acordo com as cidades e/ou estados. Por meio de estatística descritiva, agrupamos dois conjuntos de dados disponibilizados pelo Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE).

Resumo: Nos últimos anos, o debate sobre financiamento eleitoral tem crescido na ciência política brasileira. Para contribuir com esse campo, esse artigo faz um estudo de caso dos candidatos a vereadores do Partido NOVO nas eleições de 2020. Para tanto, questionamos qual foi o método de financiamento mais utilizado, bem como se há algum padrão no custo por voto de acordo com as cidades e/ou estados. Por meio de estatística descritiva, agrupamos dois conjuntos de dados disponibilizados pelo Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE). O primeiro diz respeito aos dados eleitorais que apontam votos por candidatos, cidades e estados; o segundo, trata dos tipos de financiamento que cada concorrente obteve durante a corrida eleitoral de 2020.

The strong point of the book is also the presentation of the implementation results where the authors demonstrate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the algorithms proposed. The book is suitable for a graduate course in nonlinear control, with the material on infinite dimensional systems introduced at the outset. The book is also of considerable interest to researchers in control theory, since, in addition to the original theoretical results followed by the detailed proofs, it provides physical examples of the systems, accompanied by their detailed mathematical models, to which the infinite dimensional control technique can be successfully applied. The book consists of seven chapters followed by four appendices and a relatively detailed index. A number of pertinent figures are incorporated into the text, as well. Chapter 1 briefly introduces the concept of Lyapunov-based control, and rigid and flexible mechanical systems description in terms of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and PDEs, respectively. It also briefly discusses real-time controller implementation. Chapter 2 addresses the problem of controller design for systems with friction. Here several design issues, such as parametric uncertainty and state inaccessibility are considered in the single-input-single-output (SISO) case, setting the stage for the multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) case considered in Chapters 3 and 4. Chapter 3 presents adaptive tracking controller design for a full state feedback. Motivated by the inaccuracy of the velocity measurements in mechanical systems, Chapter 4 extends the results of Chapter 3 to output feedback. Chapters 5 through 7 consider controller design for mechanical systems with both rigid and flexible components that produce combined ODE/PDE-based control laws. These chapters consider the case of known parameter values, giving rise to model-based control laws, as well as the challenging case of known equation structure, but unknown parameter values, giving rise to the infinite-dimensional adaptive control laws. Chapter 5 gives controller design methods for boundary control of string-type systems, while Chapter 6 gives boundary control laws for flexible beams. Chapter 7 presents controller design for several mechanical systems, including an axially moving string system, a robotic manipulator with flexible link, and a flexible rotor system. All chapters (2 through 7) present experimental evaluation of the algorithms proposed. Each chapter has an extensive list of references. Appendices provide some of the relevant mathematical facts, derivation of the bounds on the variables in the control laws, and C real-time program codes of the control laws.

Unknown parameters appearing in the system equation are either constant or spatially-varying. Distributed sensing and actuation are assumed to be available. Adaptation laws are obtained by the Lyapunov redesign method.

Here, we introduce a class of materials, elastic metastructures, that exploit resonating elements to broaden and lower Bragg gaps while reducing the mass of the system. This approach to band-gap engineering can be used for low-frequency vibration absorption and wave guiding across length scales. Architected materials that control elastic wave propagation are essential in vibration mitigation and sound attenuation. Phononic crystals and acoustic metamaterials use band-gap engineering to forbid certain frequencies from propagating through a material. However, existing solutions are limited in the low-frequency regimes and in their bandwidth of operation because they require impractical sizes and masses. Here, we present a class of materials (labeled elastic metastructures) that supports the formation of wide and low-frequency band gaps, while simultaneously reducing their global mass. To achieve these properties, the metastructures combine local resonances with structural modes of a periodic architected lattice. Whereas the band gaps in these metastructures are induced by Bragg scattering mechanisms, their key feature is that the band-gap size and frequency range can be controlled and broadened through local resonances, which are linked to changes in the lattice geometry. We demonstrate these principles experimentally, using advanced additive manufacturing methods, and inform our designs using finite-element simulations. This design strategy has a broad range of applications, including control of structural vibrations, noise, and shock mitigation.","Composite 3D-printed metastructures for low-frequency and broadband vibration absorption Significance Architected material used to control elastic wave propagation has thus far relied on two mechanisms for forming band gaps, or frequency ranges that cannot propagate: (i) Phononic crystals rely on their structural periodicity to form Bragg band gaps, but are limited in the low-frequency ranges because their unit cell size scales with wavelength; and (ii) Metamaterials overcome this size dependence because they rely on local resonances, but the resulting band gaps are very narrow. Here, we introduce a class of materials, elastic metastructures, that exploit resonating elements to broaden and lower Bragg gaps while reducing the mass of the system. This approach to band-gap engineering can be used for low-frequency vibration absorption and wave guiding across length scales. Architected materials that control elastic wave propagation are essential in vibration mitigation and sound attenuation. Phononic crystals and acoustic metamaterials use band-gap engineering to forbid certain frequencies from propagating through a material. However, existing solutions are limited in the low-frequency regimes and in their bandwidth of operation because they require impractical sizes and masses. Here, we present a class of materials (labeled elastic metastructures) that supports the formation of wide and low-frequency band gaps, while simultaneously reducing their global mass. To achieve these properties, the metastructures combine local resonances with structural modes of a periodic architected lattice. Whereas the band gaps in these metastructures are induced by Bragg scattering mechanisms, their key feature is that the band-gap size and frequency range can be controlled and broadened through local resonances, which are linked to changes in the lattice geometry. We demonstrate these principles experimentally, using advanced additive manufacturing methods, and inform our designs using finite-element simulations.

It is widely reported that anisotropic MAEs exhibit much stronger magneto-mechanical coupling than isotropic MAEs. However, most efforts to model effective magneto-mechanical properties of MAEs via homogenization focused on isotropic microstructures or those with large separations between particles, to use analytical solutions. In this work, we introduce a periodic homogenization approach to compute effective magneto-mechanical properties of anisotropic MAEs, and analyze microstructural features that enhance the magneto-mechanical coupling. Using the finite element method, we numerically determine the effect of particle shape, gap, and voids on the effective stiffness, permeability, and magneto-mechanical coupling tensors for chain-like periodic microstructures. Using insights gained from the full-field simulations, we derive an analytical expression for the magneto-mechanical coupling in the chain direction, in terms of the volume fraction, gap size, and properties of the matrix and particles. Results show that the overall magnetostriction of anisotropic MAEs is most sensitive to the gap between particles and the waviness of the particle chains, with smaller gap sizes and straighter chains yielding higher overall magnetostriction. Simulations also show that while isotropic MAEs elongate in a uniform magnetic field, anisotropic MAEs contract with much larger strain amplitudes, a result of the attractive forces between particles being much stronger in anisotropic MAEs than in isotropic MAEs.

We consider a flow at a Reynolds number of Re=400 past an airfoil at angles of attack of alpha_1 = 12 deg and alpha_2 = 15 deg. These parameters are chosen because for the baseline (rigid) case, the lower angle of attack does not exhibit vortex shedding but the higher angle of attack does. These give one natural scenarios to explore with a phononic material: for what material parameters does the material (i) trigger a steady aerodynamic flow into unsteadiness versus (ii) modulate vortex shedding in the nominally unsteady case. We focus in this manuscript in aligning the frequency of the phononic material's truncation resonance, with the underlying vortex shedding frequency inherent in the 15 deg case and latent in the 12 deg case. The truncation resonance is a natural (resonant) frequency of the diatomic chain that lies within its band gap --- a behavioral regime where stimuli applied to one end of the structure do not spatially propagate along the material. Aligning temporal frequencies of key flow behavior near the truncation resonance frequency has been argued to be beneficial for passive, adaptive attenuation of instabilities in wall-bounded transitional flows [1]. It is natural to ask, therefore, whether truncation resonance behavior can interact with aerodynamic flows, and if so what fluid-structure interplay arises. To address this question, we design the phononic material parameters such that the truncation resonance frequency matches that of the underlying vortex shedding behavior, and demonstrate that the triggered structural response is of the first structural mode, not the truncation resonance. We explain this outcome as a result of the near-constant mean lift imposed on the aerodynamic body --- the vortex shedding yields an oscillatory lift component that is of small amplitude relative to the near-constant mean lift.

We demonstrate our HB approach with an infinite Euler–Bernoulli beam example to demonstrate the passive tunability of the scattering array's frequency response with respect to energy and other system parameters, and we confirm the HB beam solutions with direct finite element simulations. Furthermore, we highlight the ubiquity of this approach by studying a nonlinear scattering array of oscillators on a infinite plate and show the sensitivity of the HB solutions to configuration symmetry by comparing the nonlinear solutions of perfectly symmetric to perturbed scattering arrays.

Furthermore, we highlight the ubiquity of this approach by studying a nonlinear scattering array of oscillators on a infinite plate and show the sensitivity of the HB solutions to configuration symmetry by comparing the nonlinear solutions of perfectly symmetric to perturbed scattering arrays. The efficacy of the discussed methodology for a broad array of nonlinear scattering problems is thus emphasized.",1

As a significant extension to the SDF, the multi-mode dataflow (MMDF) model has been proposed to specify such an application with a finite number of behaviors (or modes) and each behavior (mode) is represented by an SDF graph. The multiprocessor mapping of an MMDF is far more challenging as the design space increases with the number of modes. Instead of using traditional genetic algorithm (GA)-based design space exploration (DSE) method that encodes the design space as a whole, this article proposes a novel cooperative co-evolutionary genetic algorithm (CCGA)-based framework to efficiently explore the design space by a new problem-specific decomposition strategy in which the solutions of node mapping for each individual mode are assigned to an individual population. Besides, a problem-specific local search operator is introduced as a supplement to the global search of CCGA for further improving the search efficiency of the whole framework. Furthermore, a fitness approximation method and a hybrid fitness evaluation strategy are applied for reducing the time consumption of fitness evaluation significantly. The experimental studies demonstrate the advantage of the proposed DSE method over the previous GA-based method. The proposed method can obtain an optimization result with 2×−3× better quality using less (1/2−1/3) optimization time.","Cooperative Coevolution-based Design Space Exploration for Multi-mode Dataflow Mapping Some signal processing and multimedia applications can be specified by synchronous dataflow (SDF) models.

For its robustness with respect to noise, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been expected to have great potential for dynamic optimization. Many dynamic optimization methods, such as diversity-driven methods, memory methods, and prediction methods have been proposed based on EAs to deal with environmental changes. However, they face difficulties in adapting to fast changes in dynamic optimization as EAs normally need quite a few fitness evaluations to find a near-optimum solution. To address this issue, this article proposes a new framework of applying EAs in the context of dynamic optimization to deal with fast changing environments. We suggest that instead of online evolving (searching) solutions for the ever-changing objective function, EAs are more suitable for acquiring an archive of solutions in an offline way, which could be adopted to construct a system to provide high-quality solutions efficiently in a dynamic environment. To be specific, we formulate the offline search as a static set-oriented optimization problem. Then, a set of solutions is obtained by an EA for this set-oriented optimization problem. After this, the obtained solution set is adopted to do fast adaptation to the corresponding dynamic optimization problem. The general framework is instantiated for continuous dynamic-constrained optimization problems, and the empirical results show the potential of the proposed framework. The superiority of the framework is also verified on a dynamic vehicle routing problem with changing demands.","Dynamic Optimization in Fast-Changing Environments via Offline Evolutionary Search Dynamic optimization, for which the objective functions change over time, has attracted intensive investigations due to the inherent uncertainty associated with many real-world problems.

Researchers have also proposed various methods to make better use of surrogate models in the optimization process of EAs. However, there is no comprehensive study about how much accuracy of the built model is accurate enough to bring benefits to the optimization. Motivated by this, this work proposes a method to study the performance effect of model accuracy on surrogate model-assisted EAs.

In this study, we characterized three-dimensional continuous applied forces at the handle during handcycling HIIT and moderate intensity continuous training (MICT). These applied forces can give an early indication of joint loading, and therefore injury risk, at the shoulder. In all three directions (tangential, radial, and lateral), the maximum applied forces during HIIT were larger than those in MICT at all timepoints, which may indicate higher contact forces and loads on the shoulder during HIIT compared to MICT. The tangential and radial forces peaked twice in a propulsion cycle, while the lateral forces peaked once.

To compare acute cardiorespiratory responses during high intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) on a recumbent handcycle in persons with spinal cord injury (PwSCI).


Methods
Eleven males and nine females with chronic SCI (T3 - L5), aged 23 (9) years, participated in this within-subject design. Based off peak power outputs from an incremental test to exhaustion, participants engaged in a HIIT and MICT session at matched workloads on a recumbent handcycle. Workloads (Joules), time, oxygen uptake (VO2), metabolic equivalent of task (MET), heart rate (HR), and energy expenditure (kcal) were recorded during HIIT and MICT.


Results
Total workload was similar across HIIT (87820 ± 24021 Joules) and MICT sessions (89044 ± 23696 Joules; p > .05). HIIT (20.00 [.03] minutes) was shorter in duration than MICT (23.20 [2.56]; p < .01). Average VO2 (20.96 ± 4.84 vs. 129.38 ± 19.13 mL/kg/min O2), MET (7.54 ± 2.00 vs. 6.21 ± 1.25), and HR (146.26 ± 13.80 vs. 129.38 ± 19.13 beats per minute) responses were significantly greater during HIIT than MICT (p < .01). Participants burned significantly more kilocalories during HIIT (128.08 ± 35.65) than MICT (118.93 ± 29.58; p < .01) and at a faster rate (6.40 ± 1.78 [HIIT] vs. 5.09 ± 1.14 [MICT] kcal/min; p < .01).

To compare acute cardiorespiratory responses during high intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) on a recumbent handcycle in persons with spinal cord injury (PwSCI).


Methods
Eleven males and nine females with chronic SCI (T3 - L5), aged 23 (9) years, participated in this within-subject design. Based off peak power outputs from an incremental test to exhaustion, participants engaged in a HIIT and MICT session at matched workloads on a recumbent handcycle. Workloads (Joules), time, oxygen uptake (VO2), metabolic equivalent of task (MET), heart rate (HR), and energy expenditure (kcal) were recorded during HIIT and MICT.


Results
Total workload was similar across HIIT (87820 ± 24021 Joules) and MICT sessions (89044 ± 23696 Joules; p > .05). HIIT (20.00 [.03] minutes) was shorter in duration than MICT (23.20 [2.56]; p < .01). Average VO2 (20.96 ± 4.84 vs. 129.38 ± 19.13 mL/kg/min O2), MET (7.54 ± 2.00 vs. 6.21 ± 1.25), and HR (146.26 ± 13.80 vs. 129.38 ± 19.13 beats per minute) responses were significantly greater during HIIT than MICT (p < .01). Participants burned significantly more kilocalories during HIIT (128.08 ± 35.65) than MICT (118.93 ± 29.58; p < .01) and at a faster rate (6.40 ± 1.78 [HIIT] vs. 5.09 ± 1.14 [MICT] kcal/min; p < .01).


Conclusion
HIIT elicits greater increases in oxygen uptake and HR than MICT in PwSCI. In significantly less time, HIIT also burned more calories than MICT.","Cardiorespiratory Responses to an Acute Bout of High Intensity Interval Training and Moderate Intensity Continuous Training on a Recumbent Handcycle in People With Spinal Cord Injury: A Within-Subject Design.

Engineering students are excited and motivated to learn; however, some may struggle to absorb material when it is presented in a traditional 50 minute lecture format. In-class demonstrations have been shown to increase student engagement with lecture material. In particular, in large courses with multiple instructors, it can be difficult to consistently deliver high quality demonstrations across different lecture sections. One potential solution to this problem is to use video demonstrations, rather than live ones. In this work, we created videos for an introductory electronics course to be presented to students as in-class demonstrations. These demonstrations illustrate practical applications of concepts discussed in lectures, and make use of the same hardware and instruments that students work with in labs. The videos were presented to a single section within the larger course comprising four sections, totaling 450 students. The videos included comprehension questions to measure student engagement and understanding of the topic shown. After the video, students were asked to evaluate their level of enjoyment and self-assurance in applying the demonstrated concepts in lab. At the end of the semester, students will be asked additional reflective questions regarding if the videos improved their lecture experience and if the videos improved their perceived self-efficacy in the lab. While the study is ongoing, preliminary data suggests that students have found the demonstrations enjoyable and that the videos have improved the student's overall enjoyment of lectures.","Board 82: Work in Progress: Examination of Video Demonstrations as an Alternate Content-Delivery Method Abstract In this work in progress study, we examine the impact of video demonstrations on the enjoyment and perceived self-efficacy of students in an introduction to electronics course.

A two-dimensional porous-electrode model is used to predict the performance of NID cells operating at sea- and brackish-water salinity-levels by simulating electrolyte transport, membrane polarization, and simultaneous electrochemistry. Anion- selective membranes are used to isolate electrodes in NID cells because simulations showed substantial drop from inﬂuent salinity (63%) compared to porous separators used in conventional NIBs (22%). Symmetric NIB intercalants and energy recovery were used to minimize energy consumption. A Na 0.44 MnO 2 -based NID-cell with 0.5 mm-thick electrodes desalinated 700 mM inﬂuent by 63% while consuming only 50% more energy (0.74 kWh/m 3 ) than thermodynamic minimum when cycled at C/2 rate. The high volumetric charge-capacity of NIB intercalants enabled 59–64% drop in inﬂuent salinity with water-recovery levels up to 80% and 95% for 700 mM and 70 mM inﬂuent, respectively. The present predictions of NID performance are optimistic (side reactions, intercalant decomposition, membrane leakage, and competing cation-intercalation are neglected), providing mechanistic insights into NID operation that will guide NID development in the future. Li-ion porous-electrode ﬁlms can be fabricated with effective elec- tronic conductivity of 20–400 S/m depending on binder and carbon content. 49 Further, ohmic polarization inside the cell is dominated by bulk ionic-transport resistance when effective electronic-conductivity exceeds the effective ionic-conductivity (here, 1.6 S/m at 700 mol/m 3 salt concentration with 40% porosity). We show later that the results are insensitive to the choice of effective electronic-conductivity. The relationship between pore-scale velocity and superﬁcial velocity was incorrectly described in the original manuscript [ Journal of the Electrochemical Society , 163 (3) A530–A539 (2016)] and has been corrected here. Two equations in the original manuscript that expressed the superﬁcial velocity contained erroneous factors that have been removed, as well. Further, the equation for membrane polarization presented originally contained a sign error that has been corrected here. In all cases, the results originally presented utilized the correct equations, and therefore no results were affected by these errors. In addition, several technical terms have been updated and their meanings clariﬁed here.

A two-dimensional porous-electrode model is used to predict the performance of NID cells operating at sea- and brackish-water salinity-levels by simulating electrolyte transport, membrane polarization, and simultaneous electrochemistry. Anion- selective membranes are used to isolate electrodes in NID cells because simulations showed substantial drop from inﬂuent salinity (63%) compared to porous separators used in conventional NIBs (22%). Symmetric NIB intercalants and energy recovery were used to minimize energy consumption. A Na 0.44 MnO 2 -based NID-cell with 0.5 mm-thick electrodes desalinated 700 mM inﬂuent by 63% while consuming only 50% more energy (0.74 kWh/m 3 ) than thermodynamic minimum when cycled at C/2 rate. The high volumetric charge-capacity of NIB intercalants enabled 59–64% drop in inﬂuent salinity with water-recovery levels up to 80% and 95% for 700 mM and 70 mM inﬂuent, respectively. The present predictions of NID performance are optimistic (side reactions, intercalant decomposition, membrane leakage, and competing cation-intercalation are neglected), providing mechanistic insights into NID operation that will guide NID development in the future. Li-ion porous-electrode ﬁlms can be fabricated with effective elec- tronic conductivity of 20–400 S/m depending on binder and carbon content. 49 Further, ohmic polarization inside the cell is dominated by bulk ionic-transport resistance when effective electronic-conductivity exceeds the effective ionic-conductivity (here, 1.6 S/m at 700 mol/m 3 salt concentration with 40% porosity). We show later that the results are insensitive to the choice of effective electronic-conductivity. The relationship between pore-scale velocity and superﬁcial velocity was incorrectly described in the original manuscript [ Journal of the Electrochemical Society , 163 (3) A530–A539 (2016)] and has been corrected here. Two equations in the original manuscript that expressed the superﬁcial velocity contained erroneous factors that have been removed, as well. Further, the equation for membrane polarization presented originally contained a sign error that has been corrected here. In all cases, the results originally presented utilized the correct equations, and therefore no results were affected by these errors. In addition, several technical terms have been updated and their meanings clariﬁed here.

Here, we train machine-learning (ML) models to learn DFT-calculated energy landscapes of nickel hexacyanoferrate PBA lattices with various lattice hydration degrees, oxidation states, and types of intercalated alkali cations based on various three-particle feature parameters. This ML approach is enabled by using gradient-boosted regression trees with features that are rotationally invariant geometric parameters. ML model accuracy is shown to be a cation-specific indicator of correlations between energy and polyatomic arrangements. Overlap population analysis among correlated atoms further confirms that such correlations are caused by the competition for dative bonding between Lewis-acid intercalated cations and Lewis bases (cyanide and oxygen in ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{O}$). Examination of lowest-energy structures reveals that cation hydrophilicity and bare ionic radius determine dative-bonding strength, resulting in cation-${\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ ordering in interstitial space. The projected energy landscapes of hydrated PBA lattices is also explored in subspaces spanned by certain many-particle feature parameters inspired by ML analysis. The downhill traces in such landscapes indicate that lattice distortion is accompanied by two kinds of collective movements: (1) rearrangements in the hydration shells around small and hydrophilic cations and (2) collective attack of ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ molecules on nickel-cyanide bonds promoted by large, hydrophobic cations.","Linking the polyatomic arrangements of interstitial

Overlap population analysis among correlated atoms further confirms that such correlations are caused by the competition for dative bonding between Lewis-acid intercalated cations and Lewis bases (cyanide and oxygen in ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{O}$). Examination of lowest-energy structures reveals that cation hydrophilicity and bare ionic radius determine dative-bonding strength, resulting in cation-${\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ ordering in interstitial space. The projected energy landscapes of hydrated PBA lattices is also explored in subspaces spanned by certain many-particle feature parameters inspired by ML analysis. The downhill traces in such landscapes indicate that lattice distortion is accompanied by two kinds of collective movements: (1) rearrangements in the hydration shells around small and hydrophilic cations and (2) collective attack of ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ molecules on nickel-cyanide bonds promoted by large, hydrophobic cations.",3

The broader aim is to develop an eddy-diffusivity parametrisation based on local governing variables to represent gravity-current/obstacle interactions in numerical weather prediction models. A gravity current is produced in a rectangular tank by releasing a salt solution via a lock-exchange mechanism into an aqueous ethanol solution with matched refractive index, and it is allowed to interact with the barrier. A combined particle image velocimetry and planar laser-induced fluorescence system is used to obtain instantaneous velocity and density fields. The experiments span two Reynolds numbers and four obstacle heights, with each case replicated ten times for conducting phase-aligned ensemble averaging. Four evolutionary stages of the front are identified: approach, vertical deflection, collapse and reattachment. Particular focus is placed on the vertical deflection and collapse stages (dubbed collision phase), which includes flow (hydraulic) adjustment, flow modulation over the obstacle, instabilities, turbulence and mixing, and relaxation to a gravity current downstream. The time scales for various flow stages were identified. The results demonstrate that the normalised eddy diffusivity changes significantly throughout these stages and with the dimensionless height of the obstacle.","Gravity currents past thin two-dimensional obstacles The modification of a gravity current past a thin two-dimensional barrier is studied experimentally, focusing on propagation characteristics as well as turbulence and mixing at the gravity-current head near the obstacle. The broader aim is to develop an eddy-diffusivity parametrisation based on local governing variables to represent gravity-current/obstacle interactions in numerical weather prediction models. A gravity current is produced in a rectangular tank by releasing a salt solution via a lock-exchange mechanism into an aqueous ethanol solution with matched refractive index, and it is allowed to interact with the barrier. A combined particle image velocimetry and planar laser-induced fluorescence system is used to obtain instantaneous velocity and density fields. The experiments span two Reynolds numbers and four obstacle heights, with each case replicated ten times for conducting phase-aligned ensemble averaging. Four evolutionary stages of the front are identified: approach, vertical deflection, collapse and reattachment. Particular focus is placed on the vertical deflection and collapse stages (dubbed collision phase), which includes flow (hydraulic) adjustment, flow modulation over the obstacle, instabilities, turbulence and mixing, and relaxation to a gravity current downstream. The time scales for various flow stages were identified. The results demonstrate that the normalised eddy diffusivity changes significantly throughout these stages and with the dimensionless height of the obstacle.",3

Using a combination of particle image velocimetry (PIV) in a custom-built simulator and large-eddy simulations (LES), we analyzed vortex flows at swirl ratios of S=4.66, 1.25, and 0.33. The results demonstrate that vortex flow characteristics strongly depend on S, with improved agreement between experimental and numerical data when employing flow-based swirl ratio definitions. Vortex wandering was quantified in experiments, and corrections were applied to refine tangential and radial velocity profiles. At S=0.33 and 1.25 in experiments and S=1.25 and 4.66 in simulations, the vortex transitioned from a single-celled to a double-celled structure, with further evolution into multi-celled vortices at the highest swirl ratio, substantially modifying circulation patterns. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) characterized the coherent structures governing vortex dynamics and their dependence on swirl ratio, revealing distinct physical features associated with each vortex regime.","Influence of swirl ratio on the structure and dynamics of tornado-like vortices We investigated the flow dynamics of tornado-like vortices, examining the influence of swirl ratio, S, defined as the ratio of tangential to radial momentum at the vortex base, on their structural characteristics.

Particle tracking velocimetry was used to obtain a comprehensive dataset of settling motions, which we use to train neural networks that model the spatial evolution of a spherical particle without explicitly resolving the surrounding fluid dynamics. We employ deterministic neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) and stochastic neural stochastic differential equations (NSDEs) to reconstruct the sphere's trajectory and capture key statistical features of the settling process. The models are evaluated based on short- and long-time dynamics, including ensemble-averaged velocity evolution, settling time distributions, and probability density functions of the final settling positions. We also examine the correlation between lateral displacement and streamwise velocity and assess the impact of dataset size on predictive accuracy. While NODEs excel in trajectory reconstruction and generalization across different initial conditions, NSDEs effectively capture statistical trends in the long-time behavior but are more sensitive to data availability. Acceleration profiles computed via second-order finite difference schemes confirm that both approaches accurately capture long-time dynamics, though short-time transients pose challenges.","Data-driven modeling of a settling sphere in a quiescent medium We develop data-driven models to predict the dynamics of a freely settling sphere in a quiescent Newtonian fluid using experimentally obtained trajectories.

A robust method is necessary to extrapolate wind data collected at lower mast heights to higher locations. Current extrapolation methods are typically constrained in their applicable height range, requiring the development of a new model to accommodate the trend toward larger wind turbines. The proposed formulation is based on extrapolating the Weibull shape and scale parameters from a reference height and assuming a power law velocity profile controlled by the wind shear exponent. The extrapolation function was derived by stretching the Weibull distribution to align with a power law relating average wind speed to height, followed by normalization of the result. Also, a revised empirical formula for the vertical extrapolation of Weibull parameters to heights exceeding 100 m is proposed and validated for accuracy.

The cavity is initially filled with a fluid. The diaphragm is then actuated by a voltage between the diaphragm and the cavity door to compress the fluid. When the pressure exceeds a certain value, the fluid is expelled. During actuation, the electrostatic attractive force of the substrate and the pressure rise in the fluid lead to the bending and stretching of the diaphragm. Thus, the prediction of the pump performance (e.g., fluid pressure, diaphragm stresses) requires the solution of a coupled nonlinear elasto-electro-hydrodynamic problem. In this paper, a simplified analytical model is developed to predict the state of an electrostatically actuated micro pump at equilibrium. The state includes the deformed shape and the internal stresses of the diaphragm and the pressure of the fluid when the actuator is subjected to a given applied dc voltage. The model is based on the minimization of the total energy consisting of the capacitive energy, the strain energy of the diaphragm, and the energy of the fluid which is considered to be an ideal gas. The method is employed to study two pumps, one with an axisymmetric single cavity, and the other with an axisymmetric annular cavity (a cavity with an island in the middle). In the former case, upon actuation, the diaphragm contacts the cavity door from the outer periphery. Thus, energy is a function of the radius of the contact front, and equilibrium configuration is achieved at a radius where the derivative of the energy with respect to the radius vanishes. In the latter case, upon actuation, the diaphragm contacts the cavity from both of the inner and the outer peripheries. Here, equilibrium is reached when the derivatives of the energy with respect to the radii of both of the inner and outer periphery contact points vanish. It is expected that most practical pumps can be analyzed by one of the two formulations presented in the paper. Our analyses of both pumps indicate that the pressure of the gas at equilibrium increases only slightly when the stiffness of the diaphragm is increased, whereas it changes nearly inversely with the thickness of the dielectric between the diaphragm electrode and the cavity floor. Also, as expected, the pressure increases as the initial volume of the cavity (i.e., the volume of the gas to be compressed) is decreased. Furthermore, we find that the calculated stresses in the diaphragm do not exceed the typical yield stress values of many glassy polymers, a candidate material for the diaphragm. Therefore, the assumption of a linear elastic diaphragm employed in the proposed model does not put a limitation on the predictions. Dielectric breakdown may be a limiting factor for the maximum attainable pressure rather than the mechanical strength of the diaphragm material. Although stresses are low, they may be severe enough to cause delamination between different layers in the diaphragm, too.","Analytical modeling of electrostatic membrane actuator for micro pumps A large class of micro pumps consists of a cavity in a substrate, a diaphragm that seals the cavity, and inlets and outlets for the cavity which are controlled by valves.

Evidence is presented indicating that interparticle spacing measured in wavelengths is the most critical parameter to gauge the importance of dependent scattering and that high particle concentration alone is no indication that scattering is dependent. The results have direct application to the design of packed/fluidized bed systems wherein thermal radiation is a significant heat transfer mode.",2

Dispersion models (Sellmeier and Lorentz models) showed that, as the oxygen flow ratio decreased, the resonance energy also decreased. This suggests that a decreased oxygen flow ratio induces more defects, which situate themselves below the bandgap and eventually lower the bandgap. For these oxide films, a homogeneous composition assumption seemed satisfactory to describe the variety of optical measurements.",3

As an initial step toward this long-term objective, the aim of this study was to determine if an image registration strategy could be used to convert the whole-muscle average architectural properties observed in the extended joint position to those of a flexed position, following passive rotation. DTI and high-resolution fat/water scans were acquired in the lower leg of seven healthy participants on a 3T MR system in + 20° and −10° ankle positions. The diffusion and anatomical images from the two positions were used to propagate DTI fiber-tracts from seed points along a mesh representation of the aponeurosis of fiber insertion. The −10° and + 20° anatomical images were registered and the displacement fields were used to transform the mesh and fiber-tracts from the + 20° to the −10° position.

The whole-muscle average fiber-tract length, pennation angle, curvature, and physiological cross-sectional areas estimates did not differ significantly. DTI fiber-tracts in plantarflexion can be transformed to dorsiflexion position without significantly affecting the average architectural characteristics of the fiber-tracts.

Of the analytical regression models tested, linear regression models had the best performance for predicting vertical GRF data in foals with an average absolute error percent of 7.97% during trotting and 2.39% during walking, compared to a non-linear logistic model with an error of 8.38%. The model was converted to Python and implemented to predict GRF data for foals using the subject velocity and limb length as input.

Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine if mTOR-inhibition by rapamycin can modify OA pathology in aging non-human primates and female mice. Methods Common marmosets were administered oral rapamycin (1mg/kg/day) or vehicle starting near mid-life until death. Five-month-old, female C57BL/6J mice were treated with vehicle or rapamycin (IP, 2mg/kg, 3x/week) for 8-weeks following non-invasive ACL rupture. Knee OA pathology was assessed via microCT and histology. Phosphorylation of mTORC1 (p-RPS6S235/36) and mTORC2 (p-AktS473, p-NDRG1T638, p-PKCαT348) substrates were evaluated via western blot in articular cartilage, meniscus, and/or infrapatellar fat pad. ATDC5 cells were cultured with rapamycin to determine time and dose effects on mTORC1/2 signaling. Results In marmosets, rapamycin did not impact age-related radiographic OA severity or cartilage pathology but increased medial meniscus calcification and lowered lateral tibia subchondral thickness, particularly in females. In female mice, rapamycin worsened ACLR-induced meniscus calcification and cartilage pathology. In marmoset and mouse joint tissues, rapamycin inhibited mTORC1 and increased p-AktS473 but not p-NDRG1T638 or p-PKCαT348. This mTOR signaling pattern was replicated in ATDC5 cells during exposure to low concentrations of rapamycin.

While spontaneous violations of the second law of thermodynamics always follow the fluctuation theorem, time and spatial dependencies of the dissipation as a random process are determined for multiple regimes. Given that grain rotations are degrees of freedom separate from grain translations, the dissipation is calculated from a micropolar model. In monosized disk systems, it is found that the dissipation is Gaussian and, for successively smaller systems, it tends to have a skewed Cauchy probability distribution. Multi-diameter grain flows, once a steady-state mixture of the particles occurs, are comparable to the average diameter monosized granular flow. The flows' dissipation is found to be very closely modeled by a random process with the Cauchy covariance function, whose numerical parameters imply fractal and anti-persistent long-memory characters.","Scaling, fractal, and Hurst effects in spontaneous violations of entropy inequality in granular Couette systems Planar Couette flows of granular systems are investigated at different spatial and time scales using computational dynamics to determine their stochastic characteristics.

While spontaneous violations of the second law of thermodynamics always follow the fluctuation theorem, time and spatial dependencies of the dissipation as a random process are determined for multiple regimes. Given that grain rotations are degrees of freedom separate from grain translations, the dissipation is calculated from a micropolar model. In monosized disk systems, it is found that the dissipation is Gaussian and, for successively smaller systems, it tends to have a skewed Cauchy probability distribution. Multi-diameter grain flows, once a steady-state mixture of the particles occurs, are comparable to the average diameter monosized granular flow. The flows' dissipation is found to be very closely modeled by a random process with the Cauchy covariance function, whose numerical parameters imply fractal and anti-persistent long-memory characters.",3

Most existing models consider electrical conductivity to be only temperature-dependent and evaluate tissue damage during post-processing after temperature calculation. Our model allows tissue damage to be coupled into the thermal model for a more accurate description of both RF ablation and electrosurgery. <b>Methods:</b> We model the denaturation process with an Arrhenius-type differential equation for chemical kinetics and a modified Stogryn equation for electrical conductivity under state transition. We present experimental data from two types of heating procedures at 128 kHz to validate and showcase the capability of our model. <b>Results:</b> Our model is able to capture the change in electrical conductivity during heating, cooling, and reheating procedures, which distinguishes different states and shows the irreversibility of denaturation. The model also accurately captures tissue change during slow cooking at a constant temperature, highlighting a state dependence. <b>Conclusion:</b> By incorporating state dependence into the model for electrical properties, we are able to capture the denaturation process more accurately and distinguish different degrees of damage. Our model allows the modeling of procedures involving repeated heating or cooling, which is impossible for models without a state dependence.

Endosome maturation is complex, requiring proper spatiotemporal recruitment of factors that regulate the size, maturity, and positioning of endosomal compartments. In animal cells, it also requires trafficking of endosomes on microtubules. Recent work has revealed the presence of contact sites between some endosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although these contact sites are believed to have multiple functions, the frequency, dynamics, and physical attributes of these contacts are poorly understood. Here we use high-resolution three-dimensional electron microscopy to reveal that ER tubules wrap around endosomes and find that both organelles contact microtubules at or near membrane contact sites. As endosomes traffic, they remain bound to the ER, which causes the tubular ER to rearrange its structure around dynamic endosomes at contact sites. Finally, as endosomes transition through steps of maturation, they become more tightly associated with the ER.

When we enhance these dipoles with behavioural rules from classical agent-based models, we find that they do not lead robustly to schooling because of flow-mediated interactions.

Here we present a theoretical and numerical framework which allows us to interrogate and simulate the mechanical impact of solid interfaces on the growth pattern of plant organs. We focus on the well-known waving, coiling and skewing patterns exhibited by roots of Arabidopsis thaliana when grown on inclined surfaces, serving as a minimal model of the intricate interplay with solid substrates. By modelling growing slender organs as Cosserat rods that mechanically interact with the environment, our simulations verify hypotheses of waving and coiling arising from the combination of active gravitropism and passive root-plane responses. Skewing is instead related to intrinsic twist due to cell file rotation. Numerical investigations are outfitted with an analytical framework that consistently relates transitions between straight, waving, coiling and skewing patterns with substrate tilt angle. Simulations are found to corroborate theory and recapitulate a host of reported experimental observations, thus providing a systematic approach for studying in silico plant organs behavior in relation to their environment.

In nature, many such structures are adapted to manipulate flows for feeding, locomotion or energy harvesting, through mechanisms that are often not fully understood. While simulations can support the analysis (and subsequent translational engineering) of these systems, extreme fibers' aspect-ratios, large elastic deformations and two-way coupling with three-dimensional flows, all render the problem numerically challenging.

While exercise has been reported to promote muscle secretion, little is known about the effects of neuronal innervation and activity on the yield and molecular composition of biologically active molecules from muscle. As neuromuscular diseases and disabilities associated with denervation impact muscle metabolism, we hypothesize that neuronal innervation and firing may play a pivotal role in regulating secretion activities of skeletal muscles. We examined this hypothesis using an engineered neuromuscular tissue model consisting of skeletal muscles innervated by motor neurons. The innervated muscles displayed elevated expression of mRNAs encoding neurotrophic myokines, such as interleukin-6, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and FDNC5, as well as the mRNA of peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α, a key regulator of muscle metabolism. Upon glutamate stimulation, the innervated muscles secreted higher levels of irisin and exosomes containing more diverse neurotrophic microRNAs than neuron-free muscles. Consequently, biological factors secreted by innervated muscles enhanced branching, axonal transport, and, ultimately, spontaneous network activities of primary hippocampal neurons in vitro. Overall, these results reveal the importance of neuronal innervation in modulating muscle-derived factors that promote neuronal function and suggest that the engineered neuromuscular tissue model holds significant promise as a platform for producing neurotrophic molecules.","Neuronal innervation regulates the secretion of neurotrophic myokines and exosomes from skeletal muscle Myokines and exosomes, originating from skeletal muscle, are shown to play a significant role in maintaining brain homeostasis.

These surfaces are designed to be Cassie stable and favor the formation of suspended droplets on top of the nanostructures as compared to partially wetting droplets which locally wet the base of the nanostructures. These suspended droplets promise minimal contact line pinning and promote passive droplet shedding at sizes smaller than the characteristic capillary length. However, the gas films underneath such droplets may significantly hinder the overall heat and mass transfer performance. We investigated droplet growth dynamics on superhydrophobic nanostructured surfaces to elucidate the importance of droplet morphology on heat and mass transfer. By taking advantage of well-controlled functionalized silicon nanopillars, we observed the growth and shedding behavior of suspended and partially wetting droplets on the same surface during condensation. Environmental scanning electron microscopy was used to demonstrate that initial droplet growth rates of partially wetting droplets were 6× larger than that of suspended droplets. We subsequently developed a droplet growth model to explain the experimental results and showed that partially wetting droplets had 4-6× higher heat transfer rates than that of suspended droplets. On the basis of these findings, the overall performance enhancement created by surface nanostructuring was examined in comparison to a flat hydrophobic surface. We showed these nanostructured surfaces had 56% heat flux enhancement for partially wetting droplet morphologies and 71% heat flux degradation for suspended morphologies in comparison to flat hydrophobic surfaces. This study provides insights into the previously unidentified role of droplet wetting morphology on growth rate, as well as the need to design Cassie stable nanostructured surfaces with tailored droplet morphologies to achieve enhanced heat and mass transfer during dropwise condensation.","Effect of droplet morphology on growth dynamics and heat transfer during condensation on superhydrophobic nanostructured surfaces.

We investigated droplet growth dynamics on superhydrophobic nanostructured surfaces to elucidate the importance of droplet morphology on heat and mass transfer. By taking advantage of well-controlled functionalized silicon nanopillars, we observed the growth and shedding behavior of suspended and partially wetting droplets on the same surface during condensation. Environmental scanning electron microscopy was used to demonstrate that initial droplet growth rates of partially wetting droplets were 6× larger than that of suspended droplets. We subsequently developed a droplet growth model to explain the experimental results and showed that partially wetting droplets had 4-6× higher heat transfer rates than that of suspended droplets. On the basis of these findings, the overall performance enhancement created by surface nanostructuring was examined in comparison to a flat hydrophobic surface. We showed these nanostructured surfaces had 56% heat flux enhancement for partially wetting droplet morphologies and 71% heat flux degradation for suspended morphologies in comparison to flat hydrophobic surfaces. This study provides insights into the previously unidentified role of droplet wetting morphology on growth rate, as well as the need to design Cassie stable nanostructured surfaces with tailored droplet morphologies to achieve enhanced heat and mass transfer during dropwise condensation.",3

The purpose of the current work is to provide a procedure for estimating the uncertainty associated with time-averaged two-dimensional flow field measurements obtained by means of PIV. Four sources of uncertainty are assessed: equipment, particle lag, sampling size, and processing algorithm. An example uncertainty analysis is conducted for a transverse sonic jet injected into a supersonic crossflow. This flow was selected due to its wide range of flow field phenomena (bow shock, Mach disk, barrel shock, shear layers, boundary layers, etc.). However, the analysis is not specific to the example flow field and may be generally applied to any mean velocity field. In more completely assessing the uncertainty of PIV in measuring a complicated flow field, it is proposed that tools can be developed to estimate the uncertainty throughout the image instead of just giving a single value.","A Practical Approach to PIV Uncertainty Analysis While PIV is an established experimental technique for determining a velocity field, quantifying the uncertainty related with this method remains a challenging task.

The laser spark was created by focusing a 180-mJ beam from the second harmonic (wavelength of 532 nm) of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser with a 100-mm focal length lens. For early times, between 50 ns and 1 μs, images of the spark emission have been obtained to characterize the geometry. Also the temperature and electron number density were measured from the emission spectra between 490 and 520 nm where 46 N II lines are observed. The methodology of fitting the experimental data to the modeled spectra to deduce the temperature and electron number density is described. For the initial temporal range, the temperature peaks at approximately 50,000 K and decays over the first 1 μs. The electron number density peaks at approximately 10 19 cm -3 , decaying only slightly slower than t -1 . For the longer temporal evolution, from 20 to 1000 μs, planar temperature measurements were achieved using filtered Rayleigh scattering. The peak temperature starts at approximately 4100 K at 20 μs and decays to 580 K by 1 ms. The planar temperature images show a center jet propagating in the opposite direction as the initiating laser beam, which induces a vortex ring (or torus) propagating in the direction of the beam. The evolution of the position and radius of the torus structure is described and fit with a power law utilized by previous investigators. The temperature of the plasma created by laser-induced optical breakdown appears to fit quite well using a triple exponential over the four orders of magnitude of temporal range where measurements were conducted.","Temporal and Spatial Evolution of a Laser Spark in Air Experiments were conducted to quantify the temperature and electron number density of a laser spark formed in air.

In this work, we establish the crystallographic origin of ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN configurations heterodeformed relative to high-symmetry configurations such as the AA-stacking and the 21.786789 $\circ$ twisted configuration, using Smith normal form bicrystallography. We then demonstrate out-of-plane ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN across configurations vicinal to both the AA and $\Sigma 7$ stacking.

For $\Sigma 7$-vicinal systems, where reliable interatomic potentials are lacking, we develop a density-functional-theory-informed continuum framework--the bicrystallography-informed frame-invariant multiscale (BFIM) model, which captures out-of-plane ferroelectricity in heterodeformed configurations vicinal to the $\Sigma 7$ stacking. Interface dislocations in these large heterodeformed bilayer configurations exhibit markedly smaller Burgers vectors compared to the interface dislocations in small-twist and small-strain bilayer hBN.

In this work, we develop two multiscale models to predict the interface friction drag coefficient of an arbitrarily heterodeformed bilayer graphene (BG) system─an atomistically informed dynamic Frenkel-Kontorova (DFK) model and a discrete dislocation (DD) model. The DFK and DD models are motivated by molecular dynamics simulations of friction in heterodeformed BG.

It has been suggested that particles from combustion sources are more relevant to human health than are particles from other sources, but the impact of policies directed at reducing PM from combustion processes is usually relatively small when effects are estimated for a reduction in the total mass concentration. Objectives: We evaluated the value of black carbon particles (BCP) as an additional indicator in air quality management. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of health effects of BCP compared with PM mass based on data from time-series studies and cohort studies that measured both exposures. We compared the potential health benefits of a hypothetical traffic abatement measure, using near-roadway concentration increments of BCP and PM2.5 based on data from prior studies. Results: Estimated health effects of a 1-μg/m3 increase in exposure were greater for BCP than for PM10 or PM2.5, but estimated effects of an interquartile range increase were similar. Two-pollutant models in time-series studies suggested that the effect of BCP was more robust than the effect of PM mass. The estimated increase in life expectancy associated with a hypothetical traffic abatement measure was four to nine times higher when expressed in BCP compared with an equivalent change in PM2.5 mass. Conclusion: BCP is a valuable additional air quality indicator to evaluate the health risks of air quality dominated by primary combustion particles.","Black Carbon as an Additional Indicator of the Adverse Health Effects of Airborne Particles Compared with PM10 and PM2.5 Background: Current air quality standards for particulate matter (PM) use the PM mass concentration [PM with aerodynamic diameters ≤ 10 μm (PM10) or ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5)] as a metric.

Quantitative analysis of adverse effects, which can guide public debate and policy development in this area, is limited and generally scattered across environmental, human health, and other science domains. The aim of this study was to bring together and, where possible, quantify and aggregate the effects of national-scale livestock production on 17 impact categories, ranging from impacts of particulate matter, emerging infectious diseases and odor annoyance to airborne nitrogen deposition on terrestrial nature areas and greenhouse gas emissions. Effects were estimated and scaled to total Dutch livestock production, with system boundaries including feed production, manure management and transport, but excluding slaughtering, retail and consumption. Effects were expressed using eight indicators that directly express Impact in the sense of the Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Response framework, while the remaining 14 express Pressures or States. Results show that livestock production may contribute both positively and negatively to human health with a human disease burden (expressed in disability-adjusted life years) of up to 4% for three different health effects: those related to particulate matter, zoonoses, and occupational accidents. The contribution to environmental impact ranges from 2% for consumptive water use in the Netherlands to 95% for phosphorus transfer to soils, and extends beyond Dutch borders. While some aggregation across impact categories was possible, notably for burden of disease estimates, further aggregation of disparate indicators would require normative value judgement. Despite difficulty of aggregation, the assessment shows that impacts receive a different contribution of different animal sectors. While some of our results are country-specific, the overall approach is generic and can be adapted and tuned according to specific contexts and information needs in other regions, to allow informed decision making across a broad range of impact categories.","Effects of Dutch livestock production on human health and the environment.

However, there is still limited evidence in epidemiological studies that the OP of PM is more closely associated with health effects than PM mass or other air pollution components. Our aims were to assess the association between long-term exposure to OP of PM2.5 and cause-specific mortality in the Netherlands. Our second aim was to evaluate whether OP of PM2.5 was more consistently associated with mortality than PM mass, NO2 and PM2.5absorbance. Methods We used land-use regression to estimate annual average concentrations of OP, PM mass concentrations, NO2 and PM2.5 -absorbance at the home addresses for all addresses in the Netherlands. We assessed OP using electron spin resonance (OPESR) and dithiothreitol assays (OPDTT). We linked annual average concentrations to a cohort of 7.1 million individuals 30 years or older, with follow-up for seven years (2004-2011). We used cox proportional hazard models to estimate hazard ratios, adjusting for individual and area-level confounders. Results In single pollutant models, both OPDTT and OPESR were significantly associated with non-accidental, respiratory and lung cancer mortality. OPDTT was also significantly associated with circulatory disease mortality. For OPDTT, these associations were generally insensitive to adjustment for co-pollutants. Associations for OPESR were less consistent in two pollutant models. Associations for PM2.5 with all cause, respiratory and lung cancer mortality all remained significant after adjustment for co-pollutants, including OP, while associations with circulatory disease mortality (only) lost significance after adjustment for OPDTT. Conclusions OPDTT was significantly associated with cause-specific mortality in the Netherlands, but did not fully explain the associations with PM2.5.","Particulate Matter Oxidative Potential and Mortality in 7 Million Adults – The Dutch Environmental Longitudinal Study (DUELS) Introduction The oxidative potential (OP) of particulate matter (PM) has been proposed as a more health relevant metric than PM mass.

Much of the work on this problem existing in the literature is focused on the so-called single-unit RAS model, which is the simplest model in the considered class of RASs. Furthermore, due to a well-established result stating that, even for single-unit RASs, the computation of the maximally permissive DAP is intractable (NP-hard), many researchers (including our group) have focused on obtaining good suboptimal policies which are computationally tractable (scalable) and provably correct.

Much of the work on this problem existing in the literature is focused on the so-called single-unit RAS model, which is the simplest model in the considered class of RASs. Furthermore, due to a well-established result stating that, even for single-unit RASs, the computation of the maximally permissive DAP is intractable (NP-hard), many researchers (including our group) have focused on obtaining good suboptimal policies which are computationally tractable (scalable) and provably correct.

This work explores the use of an SMP to design an adhesive gripper that picks and places a target solid object employing the reversible dry adhesion of an SMP. The numerical and experimental results reveal that an ideal compositional and topological SMP adhesive design can significantly improve its adhesion strength and reversibility, leading to a strong grip force and a minimal release force.

Based on these findings, an adhesive gripper is designed, fabricated, and tested. Remarkably, the SMP adhesive gripper interacts not only with flat and smooth dry surfaces, but also moderately rough and even wet surfaces for pick-and-place, showing high adhesion strength (>2 standard atmospheres) which is comparable to or exceeds those of other single-surface contact grippers, such as vacuum, electromagnetic, electroadhesion, and gecko grippers.

However, extensional rheological properties have rarely been considered in work that studies rheology-printability correlations. Here, we test our hypothesis that extensional properties correlate with drawability, a key indicator of printability that signifies speed robustness, printing resolution, and gap-spanning performance. We formulated cementitious suspensions using hydroxyapatite (HAp) particles, independently tuning them for yield stress and extensibility, two crucial rheological properties, and test-printed. To enhance extensibility, we incorporated hydroxypropyl methylcellulose as a polymeric modifier, but this enhancement may decrease as yield stress increases, presenting a challenge in materials design. We modulated particle interactions to achieve a wide range of yield stress and extensibility, allowing for rigorous testing of our hypothesis. This approach created inks with high extensibility and high yield stress, generally considered mutually exclusive properties. We evaluated correlations between drawability and key rheological properties, finding the strongest positive correlation with extensional failure strains (strain-to-break) rather than yield stress. We establish a bijective property-manufacturing relationship (one-on-one mapping of shear yield stress to buildability and extensional strain-to-break to drawability) by combining our findings on drawability with previous studies on buildability. This relationship provides a comprehensive framework for designing high-performance inks that can be self-supporting, capable of high-speed printing, and allow gap-spanning features.","Stretching the Printability Metric in Direct-ink Writing with Highly Extensible Yield-Stress Fluids Direct-ink writing leverages the rheological complexity of yield-stress fluids to construct complex geometries, particularly those with large gaps across internal structures. However, extensional rheological properties have rarely been considered in work that studies rheology-printability correlations. Here, we test our hypothesis that extensional properties correlate with drawability, a key indicator of printability that signifies speed robustness, printing resolution, and gap-spanning performance. We formulated cementitious suspensions using hydroxyapatite (HAp) particles, independently tuning them for yield stress and extensibility, two crucial rheological properties, and test-printed. To enhance extensibility, we incorporated hydroxypropyl methylcellulose as a polymeric modifier, but this enhancement may decrease as yield stress increases, presenting a challenge in materials design. We modulated particle interactions to achieve a wide range of yield stress and extensibility, allowing for rigorous testing of our hypothesis. This approach created inks with high extensibility and high yield stress, generally considered mutually exclusive properties. We evaluated correlations between drawability and key rheological properties, finding the strongest positive correlation with extensional failure strains (strain-to-break) rather than yield stress.

Despite their shared mechanism, we find that FROMP is less sensitive to inhibitor concentration than room-temperature ROMP. By increasing the initiator-to-monomer ratio for a fixed inhibitor/initiator quantity, we find reduction in the ROMP background reactivity at room temperature (i.e., increased resin pot life). At elevated temperatures where inhibitor dissociation prevails, accelerated frontal polymerization rates are observed because of the concentrated presence of the initiator. Surprisingly, the strategy of employing higher initiator loading enhances both pot life and front speeds, which leads to FROMP rates exceeding prior reported values by over 5 times. This counterintuitive behavior is attributed to an increase in the proximity of the inhibitor to the initiator within the bulk resin and to whether the temperature favors coordination or dissociation of the inhibitor. A rapid method was developed for assessing resin pot life, and a straightforward model for active initiator behavior was established.

The forces involved in thread deployment and interactions among mucus and threads are key to understanding how hagfish slime rapidly assembles into a cohesive, functional network. Despite extensive interest in its biophysical properties, the mechanical forces governing thread deployment and interaction remain poorly quantified. Here, we present the first direct in situ measurements of the micromechanical forces involved in hagfish slime formation, including mucus mechanical properties, skein peeling force, thread–mucus adhesion and thread–thread cohesion. Using a custom glass-rod force sensing system, we show that thread deployment initiates when peeling forces exceed a threshold of approximately 6.8 nN. To understand the flow strength required for unravelling, we used a rheo-optic setup to impose controlled shear flow, enabling us to directly observe unravelling dynamics and determine the critical shear rate for unravelling of the skeins, which we then interpreted using an updated peeling-based force balance model. Our results reveal that thread–mucus adhesion dominates over thread–thread cohesion and that deployed threads contribute minimally to bulk shear rheology at constant flow rate. These findings clarify the physics underlying the rapid, flow-triggered assembly of hagfish slime and inform future designs of synthetic deployable fibre–gel systems.","Physics of unravelling and micromechanics of hagfish threads. Hagfish slime is a unique biological material composed of mucus and protein threads that rapidly deploy into a cohesive network when deployed in seawater. The forces involved in thread deployment and interactions among mucus and threads are key to understanding how hagfish slime rapidly assembles into a cohesive, functional network. Despite extensive interest in its biophysical properties, the mechanical forces governing thread deployment and interaction remain poorly quantified. Here, we present the first direct in situ measurements of the micromechanical forces involved in hagfish slime formation, including mucus mechanical properties, skein peeling force, thread–mucus adhesion and thread–thread cohesion. Using a custom glass-rod force sensing system, we show that thread deployment initiates when peeling forces exceed a threshold of approximately 6.8 nN. To understand the flow strength required for unravelling, we used a rheo-optic setup to impose controlled shear flow, enabling us to directly observe unravelling dynamics and determine the critical shear rate for unravelling of the skeins, which we then interpreted using an updated peeling-based force balance model. Our results reveal that thread–mucus adhesion dominates over thread–thread cohesion and that deployed threads contribute minimally to bulk shear rheology at constant flow rate. These findings clarify the physics underlying the rapid, flow-triggered assembly of hagfish slime and inform future designs of synthetic deployable fibre–gel systems.",3

Synthetic fabrication, by contrast, often relies on user-controlled, multistep methods that lack the self-organizing capabilities of natural systems. Inspired by nature, we sought chemical systems that integrate strongly coupled reaction and transport phenomena, identifying frontal ring-opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) as a method capable of creating diverse forms and functions through reactive processing. By employing discrete molecular initiators, FROMP allows precise control of key reaction steps—inhibition, initiation, and propagation. Using an integrated computational and experimental framework, we uncover how near-equilibrium inhibition dynamics, coupled with far-from-equilibrium reaction kinetics, drive pattern formation in frontally polymerized synthetic materials. We propose the concept of equilibrium-gated pattern formation, demonstrating how initiator chemistry can be tuned to achieve programmable macroscale properties. Our study reveals a surprising insight: Emergent behavior in FROMP systems arises from the inhibition-dominated regime of resin composition, expanding prior observations that such behavior is confined to a narrow compositional space near the boundary between front quenching and uniform front propagation. We identify a broader compositional window, far from the quenching regime, where emergent behavior reliably manifests. This expanded design space significantly enhances the operational flexibility of reactive systems and their capacity for self-organization.

The findings create broad opportunities for 3ω methods in biology, with utility ranging from the integration with surgical tools or implantable devices to noninvasive uses in clinical diagnostics and therapeutics.","Flexible and Stretchable 3ω Sensors for Thermal Characterization of Human Skin Characterization of the thermal properties of the surface and subsurface structures of the skin can reveal the degree of hydration, the rate of blood flow in near‐surface micro‐ and macrovasculature, and other important physiological information of relevance to dermatological and overall health status. Here, a soft, stretchable thermal sensor, based on the so‐called three omega (i.e., 3ω) method, is introduced for accurate characterization of the thermal conductivity and diffusivity of materials systems, such as the skin, which can be challenging to measure using established techniques.

Previously, solid patchy particles were explicitly engineered to define the valence and geometry of a given assembly. By contrast, this work demonstrates how mobile DNA linkers self-organize at the interface between colloidal droplets into a well-defined number of adhesive patches, that is, valence, to create order on much longer length scales. Our experiments and analytical theory are in excellent agreement, demonstrating that this valence is a thermodynamic equilibrium state, which is tuned by experimental control parameters, such as the number of DNAs, the mechanical properties of DNA, and the patch geometry. Just like atoms combine into molecules, colloids can self-organize into predetermined structures according to a set of design principles. Controlling valence—the number of interparticle bonds—is a prerequisite for the assembly of complex architectures. The assembly can be directed via solid “patchy” particles with prescribed geometries to make, for example, a colloidal diamond. We demonstrate here that the nanoscale ordering of individual molecular linkers can combine to program the structure of microscale assemblies. Specifically, we experimentally show that covering initially isotropic microdroplets with N mobile DNA linkers results in spontaneous and reversible self-organization of the DNA into Z(N) binding patches, selecting a predictable valence. We understand this valence thermodynamically, deriving a free energy functional for droplet–droplet adhesion that accurately predicts the equilibrium size of and molecular organization within patches, as well as the observed valence transitions with N. Thus, microscopic self-organization can be programmed by choosing the molecular properties and concentration of binders.

While neural operator frameworks, such as Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), have shown considerable success in single-physics settings, their extension to multiphysics problems remains poorly understood. In particular, the challenge of learning nonlinear interactions between tightly coupled physical fields has received little systematic attention. This study addresses a foundational question: should the architectural design of a neural operator reflect the strength of physical coupling it aims to model? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive, architecture-aware evaluation of DeepONet variants across three regimes: single-physics, weakly coupled, and strongly coupled multiphysics systems. We consider a reaction-diffusion equation with dual spatial inputs, a nonlinear thermo-electrical problem with bidirectional coupling through temperature-dependent conductivity, and a viscoplastic thermo-mechanical model of steel solidification governed by transient phase-driven interactions. Two operator-learning frameworks, the classical DeepONet and its sequential GRU-based extension, S-DeepONet, are benchmarked using both single-branch and multi-branch (MIONet-style) architectures. Our results demonstrate that architectural alignment with physical coupling is crucial: single-branch networks significantly outperform multi-branch counterparts in strongly coupled settings, whereas multi-branch encodings offer advantages for decoupled or single-physics problems.

The prior is then passed to a conditional video diffusion model that learns only the residual: the point-wise difference between the ground truth and the S-DeepONet prediction. By shifting the learning burden from the full solution to its much smaller residual space, diffusion can focus on sharpening high-frequency structures without sacrificing global coherence.

The hybrid approach not only lowers quantitative errors but also improves visual quality, visibly recovering fine spatial details. These results show that (i) conditioning diffusion on a physics-aware prior enables faithful reconstruction of localized features, (ii) residual learning reduces the problem, accelerating convergence and enhancing accuracy, and (iii) the same architecture transfers seamlessly from incompressible flow to nonlinear elasto-plasticity without problem-specific architectural modifications, highlighting its broad applicability to nonlinear, time-dependent continua.","Bridging Sequential Deep Operator Network and Video Diffusion: Residual Refinement of Spatio-Temporal PDE Solutions Video-diffusion models have recently set the standard in video generation, inpainting, and domain translation thanks to their training stability and high perceptual fidelity.

We determined or placed useful upper limits on the abundances of two key volatile elements, carbon and sulfur, in both stars; we also constrained the zinc abundance in PG 1225-079. In combination with previous optical data, we find strong evidence that each of these two white dwarfs has accreted a parent body that has evolved beyond primitive nebular condensation.

We determined or placed useful upper limits on the abundances of two key volatile elements, carbon and sulfur, in both stars; we also constrained the zinc abundance in PG 1225-079. In combination with previous optical data, we find strong evidence that each of these two white dwarfs has accreted a parent body that has evolved beyond primitive nebular condensation.

However, dedicated radial velocity campaigns are capable of confirming close in giant exoplanets (a few MJup) around polluted white dwarfs, where additional metal lines aid radial velocity measurements. Infrared emission from these giant exoplanets is shown to be detectable with JWST MIRI and will provide constraints on the formation of the planet.

We thus present the first estimates of rock types on exoplanets that once orbited polluted white dwarfs—stars whose atmospheric compositions record the infall of formerly orbiting planetary objects—examining cases where Mg, Si, Ca and Fe are measured with precision. We find no evidence for continental crust, or other crust types, even after correcting for core formation. However, the silicate mantles of such exoplanets are discernable: one case is Earth like, but most are exotic in composition and mineralogy. Because these exoplanets exceed the compositional spread of >4,000 nearby main sequence stars, their unique silicate compositions are unlikely to reflect variations in parent star compositions. Instead, polluted white dwarfs reveal greater planetary variety in our solar neighborhood than currently appreciated, with consequently unique planetary accretion and differentiation paths that have no direct counterparts in our Solar System.

No significant differences in compliance or adverse events were found ( P = 0.9829 and 0.0720). Epsilometer test showed that most eradication failure cases were levofloxacin‐resistant. CONCLUSIONS Adding bismuth subcitrate to levofloxacin‐based triple therapy was not more effective than not doing so, but no further side effects were noted. Both eradication therapies were equally safe and patients had the same tolerance to both regimens. Resistance rate to levofloxacin may be important when choosing second‐line therapy.",8

BMP7 promoter activation occurred through the corecruitment of HOXA13, mixed-lineage leukemia 1 lysine N-methyltransferase, WD repeat-containing protein 5, and lncRNA HoxA transcript at the distal tip (HOTTIP) to commit the epigenetic changes to the trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 in cancer cells.

Knockdown experiments demonstrated that HOTTIP contributed positively, but HOTAIR regulated negatively to HOXA13-mediated BMP7 expression in cancer cells and iPSLCs, respectively. These findings indicate that the recruitment of HOXA13–HOTTIP and HOXA13–HOTAIR to different sites in the BMP7 promoter is crucial for the oncogenic fate of human gastric cells.

This paper presents (1) an optimal prefilter model matching design for a system with an existing feedback controller, (2) a simultaneous feedforward and feedback control design in an optimal mixed sensitivity framework, and (3) a 2DOF optimal robust model matching design. The experimental results on applying these controllers show a significant improvement, as high as 330% increase in bandwidth for similar robustness and resolution over optimal feedback-only designs. Other performance objectives can be improved similarly. We demonstrate that the 2DOF freedom design achieves performance specifications that are analytically impossible for feedback-only designs.",1

Classical nucleation theory dictates that to reduce the heterogeneous nucleation of scale, the surface should have low surface energy, and be as smooth as possible.

Although lubricant-based surfaces are promising, lubricant drainage inhibits their utilization. Here, we develop methodologies to deposit slippery omniphobic covalently attached liquids (SOCAL) on arbitrary substrates. Similar to lubricant-based surfaces, SOCAL have ultra-low roughness and surface energy, enabling low nucleation rates, and eliminating the need to replenish the lubricant. To enable SOCAL coating on metals, we investigated the surface chemistry required to ensure high quality functionalization as measured by ultra-low contact angle hysteresis (< 2°). Using multi-layer deposition, we electrophoretically deposit (EPD) silicon dioxide (SiO2) as an intermediate layer between the metallic substrate and SOCAL. The necessity of SiO2 is to smoothen (< 10 nm roughness) as well as to enable the proper surface chemistry for SOCAL bonding. To characterize scaling performance, we utilized calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate scale tests, showing a 20X reduction in scale deposition rate when compared to untreated metallic substrates. Descaling tests revealed that SOCAL dramatically decreases scale adhesion. Our work not only demonstrates a robust methodology for depositing anti-scaling SOCAL coatings on metals, it develops design guidelines for the creation of anti-fouling coatings for alternate applications such as biofouling and high temperature coking.","Extreme Anti-Scaling Performance of Slippery Omniphobic Covalently Attached Liquids.

The states of the resulting tracking error dynamics is appended by another set of suitably designed states, which enable a specific time-varying coordinate transformation, which in turn results in dynamic models that are very conducive to linear control synthesis design methods. The proposed imaging mode enables higher throughput in AFM imaging without the need for significantly high resonant frequency AFM cantilever probes. This method overcomes the fundamental limitation of nonlinear input-output relationship in Amplitude Modulation AFM (AM-AFM) imaging mode by applying an appropriately chosen real-time transform on the output signal. In combination with model-based reference generation, the proposed real-time transform yields linear dynamical input-output characteristics. Simulations on detailed AFM models with ${\mathcal{H}_\infty }$ optimal control designs show the efficacy of the proposed imaging mode for feature bandwidths higher than 5% of the cantilever resonant frequency.",1

Our approach models these routing and scheduling problems as ‘equivalent’ facility location problems with side-constraints, and then employs tools from statistical physics for assigning resources (routes/vehicles) to each node (city) such that the resource allocation results in feasible, sub-optimal routes. The approach is very flexible and can incorporate side-constraints such as minimum tour-lengths, capacity constraints, schedule constraints, and reachability constraints (like CETSP). Analytically, our model results in a second-order non-linear system of complex implicit equations; and we show that an iterative approach effectively solves these equations, is equivalent to a gradient descent and converges to a local minimum. While the optimization model is non-linear, the algorithm converges to an integer optimal solution. Computationally, we compare our approach to the Simulated Annealing (SA) heuristic, the CMT-14 benchmark instances for the VRP and randomly generated instances for the CETSP. Our approach consistently outperforms SA for all constrained routing problems. On the CMT-14 benchmark instances, our approach finds the optimal (when verifiable) number of vehicles, with a cumulative tour distance within 5.7% and in comparable computation times of the best-known solutions (over all approaches for each instance). We also demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on randomly generated instances of the CETSP and discuss our results.","A Unified Maximum Entropy Principle Approach for a Large Class of Routing Problems We present a novel modeling and algorithmic approach, a Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) heuristic for Routing and Scheduling, for a large class of problems including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem (mTSP), the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and the Close-Enough Traveling Salesman Problem (CETSP).

By reformulating SCONMF as a capacity-constrained facility-location problem (CCFLP), the proposed method naturally incorporates non-negativity, orthogonality, and sparsity constraints. Specifically, our approach combines a control-barrier function (CBF) framework used in dynamic optimal control problems with a maximum-entropy-principle-based framework from facility location problems to enforce these constraints while ensuring robust factorization. Additionally, we introduce a quantitative approach for determining the true rank of W or H, which corresponds to the number of true features—an essential aspect in ONMF applications where the feature count is unknown. Simulations on various datasets demonstrate significant improvements in factorization with low reconstruction errors (up to 150 times smaller), while strictly satisfying all constraints, outperforming existing methods that struggle to balance accuracy and constraint adherence.","Orthogonal Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with Sparsity Constraints This article presents a novel approach to solving the sparsity-constrained Orthogonal Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SCONMF) problem, which decomposes a non-negative data matrix into two lower-rank non-negative matrices, X =WH, where the mixing matrix H has orthogonal rows (HH⊤=I), and an upper bound on the number of non-zero elements per row is satisfied.

This paper proposes, demonstrates, and evaluates a visionbased strategy to estimate the displacement of large civil infrastructure under in-service loading. The first step of the strategy consists of conducting a photographic survey of the structure during a typical loading event. Next, a Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) feature tracker is employed on photos to track displacements at various locations on the structure. Finally, computer vision-based techniques including camera motion compensation with 2D geometric transformations, correction for lens distortion, and localized histogram equalization of image intensity are implemented to tackle the inherent challenges with field-collected image data. This paper demonstrates the proposed vision-based strategy on a large, steel miter gate at the lock and dam on the Columbia River at The Dalles, OR. To evaluate the accuracy of the displacement estimation strategy, virtual images of a 3D photorealistic model of the gate with known displacements from a finite element analysis (FEA) model were considered. These displacements were then compared to the FEA displacements projected from the 3D model onto the image plane. The differences between these displacements, which ideally should be zero, directly indicate the error of the proposed strategy. Subsequently, displacements estimated from the field images are compared to those predicted by the FEA. Future work will investigate using these differences to generate high-density data for use in Bayesian model updating.

Interference from O2 LIF is a significant problem in lean flames for NO LIF measurements, and pressure broadening and quenching lead to increased interference with increased pressure.

II. A-X(0,1) excitation. A-X(0,1) excitation is a promising new approach for NO laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) diagnostics at elevated pressures and temperatures. We present what to our knowledge are the first detailed spectroscopic investigations within this excitation band using wavelength-resolved LIF measurements in premixed methane/air flames at pressures between 1 and 60 bar and a range of fuel/air ratios. Interference from O2 LIF is a significant problem in lean flames for NO LIF measurements, and pressure broadening and quenching lead to increased interference with increased pressure. Three different excitation schemes are identified that maximize NO/O2 LIF signal ratios, thereby minimizing the O2 interference. The NO LIF signal strength, interference by hot molecular oxygen, and temperature dependence of the three schemes are investigated.",2

Conjugate heat-transfer models based on an assumed penetration depth of the applied heating load are used to account for localized wall heating during the short durations (~0.2 to 0.3 s) of the parts of the experiments simulated in this work. The results show a marked sensitivity to trace levels of atomic oxygen (~1% by mass) in the free stream – these trace levels are a consequence of the arc-heating process at ~1 bar pressure and the use of baffles to enhance mixing of oxygen with arc-heated nitrogen.

The simulations capture the underlying physics of polymer flow from the nanometer to millimeter length scale and examine geometry and thermophysical process quantities affecting cavity filling. Variations in embossing tool geometry and polymer film thickness during viscous flow distinguish different flow driving mechanisms. Three parameters can predict polymer deformation mode: cavity width to polymer thickness ratio, polymer supply ratio and capillary number. The ratio of cavity width to initial polymer film thickness determines vertically or laterally dominant deformation. The ratio of indenter width to residual film thickness measures polymer supply beneath the indenter which determines Stokes or squeeze flow. The local geometry ratios can predict a fill time based on laminar flow between plates, Stokes flow, or squeeze flow. A characteristic NIL capillary number based on geometry-dependent fill time distinguishes between capillary- or viscous-driven flows. The three parameters predict filling modes observed in published studies of NIL deformation over nanometer to millimeter length scales. The work seeks to establish process design rules for NIL and to provide tools for the rational design of NIL master templates, resist polymers and process parameters.","Impact of polymer film thickness and cavity size on polymer flow during embossing: toward process design rules for nanoimprint lithography This paper presents continuum simulations of polymer flow during nanoimprint lithography (NIL).

As compared with earlier results in this direction, a new piecewise continuous adaptive law is introduced, along with the low-pass-filtered control signal that allows for achieving arbitrarily close tracking of the input and the output signals of the reference system, the transfer function of which is not required to be strictly positive real. Stability of this reference system is proved using a small-gain-type argument.

Sampling-based algorithms address motion planning problems by sampling random trajectories in the configuration space and evaluating their performance. However, their effectiveness is heavily dependent on the predefined sampling distributions. In dynamic environments, predefined sampling distributions often fail to adapt to real-time changes, leading to safety violations as environmental conditions deviate from initial assumptions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a guided sampling algorithm based on the model predictive path integral (MPPI) control algorithm, combining with the merits of the rapidly exploring random trees (RRT) algorithm and the control barrier function (CBF) method. The proposed RRT-CBF-guided MPPI (RC-MPPI) algorithm leverages both RRT and CBF to autonomously update the mean and covariance of the sampling distributions, utilizing current environmental information, including obstacle locations and safety constraints. The RRT initially guides the determination of the mean and covariance by considering obstacle avoidance and the target position. Subsequently, the CBF refines this preliminary determination to ensure adherence to safety constraints. The proposed RC-MPPI improves sample efficiency and enhances safety by integrating the guided sampling into the planning process. In particular, this study calculates an upper bound for the required sample size in MPPI and uses this bound to demonstrate how RC-MPPI improves sample efficiency. To assess the effectiveness of RC-MPPI, numerical simulations are conducted using both an unmanned ground vehicle model and an unmanned aerial vehicle model. The results demonstrate significant improvements in sample efficiency and safety compared to conventional MPPI.","Guided Sampling-Based Motion Planning Algorithm for Dynamic and Obstacle Cluttered Environments This paper presents a guided sampling-based algorithm for motion planning that is designed to allow safe navigation in dynamic and cluttered environments.
